TAKE NOTE: The introduction is the EXACT same as every introduction for every
guide I've written. It's literally a copy/paste up to the Version History
section. So, if you've read another one of my walkthroughs, you can skip these
first sections should you so desire.

That being said, be forewarned: There is no censorship here. The following
guide is liable to contain mild swearing, crassness, unapologeticness, and bad
jokes. You have been warned.

   /\=====================================================================/\
  /__\--={  W O A H!   E V E R Y T H I N G   L O O K S   W E I R D!  }=--/__\
 /\  /\                             [WOAH!]                             /\  /\
/__\/__\===============================================================/__\/__\

If everything you see is not aligning correctly, try widening your window.
Could be you've got your window too narrow and it's shortening the margins.

Make sure you're viewing this guide in a fixed-width font. In order for the art
to work, it must be viewed in one of the following:

    * Courier New     <--   BEST (What I use)
    * Lucida Console  <--   GOOD
    * Consolas        <--   MEH
    * Courier         <--   OLD
    * Fixedsys        <--   WHY

This whole guide fits within the exact width of 79 characters. If you are not
sure whether or not you are using a fixed-width font, use the test below:

                      IIIIIIIIIIIIIII
                      WWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

If the row of I's and row of W's are perfectly aligned, then you are using a
fixed-width font. If absolutely all else fails, try to copy and paste the guide
into a text editor (like Notepad).

   /\=====================================================================/\
  /__\---------={  N A V I G A T I N G   T H I S   G U I D E  }=---------/__\
 /\  /\                             [NAVGD]                             /\  /\
/__\/__\===============================================================/__\/__\

Stuck on a particular part? Want to pick up where you left off? All that
scrolling can be such a pain!

Infommercialing aside, I've attempted to make navigating this guide as
enjoyable as doing something you don't want to do can be. You'll notice that
beside each item in the Table of Contents is a small code in brackets...
something like: [POOP]. You'll also eventually notice that the same code is
found at the corresponding section's heading. So, if you need to get to a
specific section, hit "CTRL"/"CMD" + "F" and type in the code WITH the
brackets. There's bound to be only 2-3 occurrences of each tag, so the find
function should take you straight to the section you are looking for.

If you printed this guide out... Well, you're shit ass out, you gotta flip
through it all. Sorry.

If you have questions/concerns/comments about this guide or any other, there's
a super-secret email that you can write in to. Here it is:

        EMAIL: guides(at)mobomu.com
        RECOMMENDED SUBJECT: Your Legend of Zelda Guide Sucks, and Here's Why
        ATTN: Herc

Yep. This is our dedicated guides email. Any question you want to ask about
anything can be sent to that email. If you're going to ask us the ultimate
question of life, the universe, and everything: that answer is 42. There. Now,
you don't have to ask.

All that being said: PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY DO NOT SEND US
SPAM (SUPER PROMOTED ADVERTISING MAIL). I mean, this should go without saying,
but in the world we currently live...

Also, the (at) in the address up there is just another method of mine to try to
avoid as much SPAMing as possible. This ensures that whoever emails me is
pretty much smart enough to figure out that it's the at sign emails use. Or
that I just told you. Either way, it helps to make sure most of my emails come
from humans, and that's great.

Additionally, please only email me if you have a serious question. I wrote this
guide to essentially answer all questions. If you ask me a question that I have
already answered here in some form, chances are I will simply defer you back to
this guide (although if I'm feeling nice and I usually am, then I'll mention
the specific section that you can find your answer in). Still, I encourage you
to look for the answer here before emailing as that will help cut down on the
amount of emails that we get.

If I get a bunch of repeat offenders (i.e. the same question asked by 5+
people) then I will put it in the FAQs section. If it does exist, then check
there to see if your question has already been asked repeatedly. If, after
you've exhausted all these options, your question remains unanswered, then
feel free to email me.

In addition, I won't give out my personal gamertag unless I personally know
you. Although, you'll probably find it out if you join the discord, in
which case: Friend me if you want, don't if you don't. But I reserve the right
to not desire your online friendship and therefore ignore your request. Pretty
much if your GT is something idiotic like "xXx420_BlazeitxXx" or
"DragonSlayer1999", chances are I'll ignore the request. Not because I'm high
and mighty or anything, but because we're better than you and we know it. This
is a right that I will usually exercise. Nothing against you, I just don't like
randos.

The Mobomu gamertag is just that: Mobomu. Same rules apply here as with my
personal gamertag. Chances are that gamertag will not friend you back. We
don't usually. But you can follow us to keep up to date with what we're
currently working on.

Happy gaming.

[v1.0 > Dated: 02/19/19] The first and likely worst version of this shpadoinkle
guide. This is draft one everyone, where it all began. I'd liken it to the
creation of the universe, but I'm trying to be humble. It's more like when
Edison invented the light bulb or the development of the television across a
timespan of 150 years, albeit more revolutionary.

"Why are you guys making guides for old games?" Because we're just starting up
and we're trying to get in the game hard. Which means we have a lot of catching
up to do. So, we're catching up.

Anyway, for this version, everything was finished up to the end of the actual
walkthrough. All the extra awesome high-effort stuff was still missing the
effort part of that equation.


[v1.5 > Dated: 06/30/19] Made some updates. Added the Completion and Extras 
section and polished everything else.


[v2.0 > Dated: 09/05/19] Ran everything through Word Spelling & Grammar check.
Fixed up all that goodness nicely. Added the Zelda Classic section. Added
World Maps and block maps for Labyrinths.


[v2.5 > Dated: 10/12/19] Fixed some errors with enemy listings. Renamed
"Equipable Items" to "Items" and "Non-Equipable Items" to "Equipment". Much
nicer this way.


[v2.6 > Dated: 10/25/19] More minor formatting changes. Nothing of note.


[v3.0 > Dated: 12/30/19] Added maps of every screen with item, secret, and
enemy information. Added coordinate maps to an area referenced in the
Walkthrough where it might be helpful. Restructured Chapter 1 for First Quest
to be more efficient. Played around more with Zelda Classic and added more
links to other quest files.

Hi! Hercly Derkles here for Zelda Classic on PC, the most convenient way to
play The Legend of Zelda on your PC guaranteed! Seriously though, Zelda Classic
is awesome. If you would like to play The Legend of Zelda for free on your PC
at home, make your way to the following link:

                       http://www.zeldaclassic.com

There you will find all you need to install Zelda Classic on your PC and you'll
be off to the races. Now, this is NOT an emulator or anything like that, it is
an actual PC port/remake of the game. And to that end, it's even better than
the original. Because of its status as a full PC build, it is ever expandable,
has more quests than the original (and more will continue to come), and it has
enhanced graphics (think if Legend of Zelda came out on the SNES, so basically
just more vibrant).

So, yeah. I highly recommend Zelda Classic for some good ol' fashioned NES fun,
but better. The current version as of my writing this guide is Version 2.53.0.

You can download new quests made by fans from their website. I've included
links to the quest directory as well as my two favorite fan-made items. To play
them, just download the zip file, unzip it, and put the .qst file in the Zelda
Classic directory wherever you have it. Then select it from the Quest Options
menu in Zelda Classic.

+--------------------------+

Q: How can I cheat in Zelda Classic?

A: Cheats are only enabled in certain quests. As an example, you cannot use
cheats in the First Quest on Zelda Classic.


Q: How do I get the custom quests?

A: From the character selection screen, select your character and press A (or
whatever you've keymapped A to be). This will take you to the Quest Options
menu. From there, you can press A to load a custom quest which will give you a
browse option to look for .qst files (only if you have not started playing on
this save).


Q: How do I make my own quests?

A: It's not the easiest thing in the world, but should you desire to make your
own Legend of Zelda quest, you can do so with the zquest.exe program in the
Zelda Classic director wherever you installed it. It's not a particularly
intuitive program and has little for documentation. There was once a good
online tutorial but it seems they've stopped paying the hosting fees. Perhaps
we'll make a video for it one day.


Q: I don't have the zquest.exe file, help!

A: Stop shouting. You probably either missed it or downloaded and earlier
version of Zelda Classic where it wasn't available yet. Make sure you have the
latest version and it should be there.

Now then: how about we move on to the content you actually came here for, shall
we?... The Legend of Zelda. The game that started it all. Zelda is a franchise
that has touched many people across many generations, and I consider it a
privilege to have experienced this franchise as I grew up. The first game was
revolutionary for its time and Zelda hasn't slowed down since. It's in my
Top 3 Favorite Gaming Franchises of All-Time list, usually around 1 or 2,
trading with Halo depending on my mood.
 
So, let's get this show on the road.

This section covers the controls of the game and how to make Link do the things
you need him to do in order to survive. And yes, I'm aware the controller in
the header is clearly an N64 Controller. That's because I like N64 and grew up
playing it. For Nintendo guides, it will always be an N64 controller. Deal with
it.

And that's all for the game's controls. The game was also ported to several
other Nintendo consoles, but the controls directly mirror one of the three
above so you should be able to figure it out from there. It's a very simple
game.

Here I'll cover the game basics, which is pretty much anything that I think may
be handy to know before we get started on the actual walkthrough.

Considering that at the time of my writing this The Legend of Zelda is 33 years
old, it's a very simple game by today's standards. As such, the mechanics are
simple, sweet, and intuitive. You hack and slash your way through enemies, grab
items you need, and complete Labyrinths until you have what it takes to fight
the big bad.

There are eight Labyrinths (try to do them in order if you're starting fresh
and using this guide) plus the final boss. Your view is consistently top-down
and the map is split into square areas that you can move between (more on this
further on). And that's pretty much it. Now that you know what's what, navigate
this world and its Labyrinths and rescue Princess Zelda!

/__\/__\===============================================================/__\/__\

With time the Legend of Zelda character roster will grow. But since this is the
first game, there are only five characters that we'll be encountering
throughout the game.

+------------+
|--= Link =--|
+------------+

Link is you, the main character, the Hero with a capital H. He's the
protagonist of every Zelda game, the one who people often call Zelda because
they're confused and perhaps a little lost as well, but his name's not Zelda
damn it, it's Link. In this game, Link is young, as he is in a fair amount of
the other series games, and he is only equipped with a wooden sword and shield
to start with. You ever used a wooden sword before? They're not very effective.
But Link is in possession of something more powerful than a measly sword:
courage, and the drive to save humanity.

+-------------+
|--= Ganon =--|
+-------------+

Ganon is the big bad bitch in this game (and really all of the Zelda games).
Later he is called Ganondorf (and the name Ganon is reserved for his monster
form). Here, Ganon takes control of the Triforce of Power and attempts to
control the entire world. Thankfully, someone like Link is around to give him
a swift kick to the plums instead.

+----------------------+
|--= Princess Zelda =--|
+----------------------+

The namesake of the entire franchise (for reasons, I guess). All this confusion
with Link/Zelda could have been avoided if they'd name the franchise after Link
instead of Zelda, though "The Legend of Link" doesn't sound as good. But "The
Adventure of Link" sounds pretty good and we'll get to that game after this
one. In The Legend of Zelda, Princess Zelda sends out her faithful companion/
guardian Impa to find a hero who can defeat Ganon. Unfortunately, Zelda is 
kidnapped by Ganon shortly afterwards and Link must save her as well!

+------------+
|--= Impa =--|
+------------+

Impa is technically not in the game, but she plays a pivotal role in the story
leading up to the start of the game. Impa is sent out by Zelda to find a hero
to fight Ganon. She finds Link just in time for him to defeat Ganon's henchmen
and embark on this epic quest to take down Ganon!

+---------------+
|--= Old Man =--|
+---------------+

The Old Man appears all throughout this game. There's no verifiable proof to
determine if he is one person or many, but we'll just assume he's one person
and he's here to help. He gives you the wooden Sword at the start of the game
and appears in each Labyrinth to give you hints if you can find him. And if you
whack him with your sword, his statues will shoot fireballs at you, so don't do
that. Or do, up to you.

A LONG, LONG TIME AGO THE WORLD WAS IN AN AGE OF CHAOS.

In the midst of this chaos, in a little kingdom in the land of Hyrule, a legend 
was being handed down from generation to generation, the legend of the 
"Triforce"; golden triangles possessing mystical powers. One day, an evil army 
attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole the Triforce of Power. This 
army was led by Ganon, the powerful Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the 
World into fear and darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, 
the princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight 
fragments and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce 
from the clutches of the evil Ganon. At the same time, she commanded her most 
trustworthy nursemaid, Impa, to secretly escape into the land and go find a man 
with enough courage to destroy the evil Ganon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew 
angry, imprisoned the princess, and sent out a party in search of Impa.

Braving forests and mountains, Impa fled for her life from her pursuers. As she 
reached the very limit of her energy she found herself surrounded by Ganon's 
evil henchmen. Cornered! What could she do? ... But wait! All was not lost. A 
young lad appeared. He skillfully drove off Ganon's henchmen, and saved Impa 
from a fate worse than death.

His name was Link. During his travels he had come across Impa and Ganon's 
henchmen. Impa told Link the whole story of the princess Zelda and the evil 
Ganon. Burning with a sense of justice, Link resolved to save Zelda, but Ganon 
was a powerful opponent. He held the Triforce of power. And so, in order to 
fight off Ganon, Link had to bring the scattered eight fragments of the 
Triforce of Wisdom together to rebuild the mystical triangle. If he couldn't do 
this, there would be no chance Link could fight his way into Death Mountain 
where Ganon lived.

Can Link really destroy Ganon and save Princess Zelda? 

Only your skill can answer that question. Good luck. Use the Triforce wisely.

This walkthrough was written based on my approximately 4th playthrough. I'm
now playing on the Nintendo Switch Online version of the game and it's quite
nice, I highly recommend it if you have a Switch, which if you're reading this
guide you probably do.

The walkthrough will take you through the game and also help you to get every
item, heart container, and secret that there is in the game. This section is
dedicated to the First Quest Playthrough and the Second Quest playthrough will
follow.

**NOTE**: I refer directly to the maps I've created for this walkthrough
constantly. It's the only effective way to write a walkthrough for this game in
my opinion. The maps operate on a grid coordinate system and are fairly
straight-forward. However, I would recommend you print out the MAP section
further down to have as a quick reference, or at least open this guide in
another tab and keep it on the map section. It'll make your life easier.

**ANOTHER NOTE**: Things that I think are important for you to see or pickup
will be in all CAPS and surrounded by a hyphequal sign (I made that up),
-=LIKE THIS=-, so that they stand out to you as you're reading.

                 +------------------------------------------+

QUICK TIPS:

1. When you die in the Overworld, you'll start back at the original screen in
the game, coordinate H8. If you die in a Labyrinth, you'll start at the
beginning of that Labyrinth.

2. Saving is love; Saving is life. Save often. If you're playing on an NES,
make sure to hold down the reset button to shut off so you don't lose your save
data.

3. Watch your health always. If you hear the "beep, beep", best be getting some
hearts or you're gonna die.

4. Rupees. Grab every rupee you see no matter what. Die for the rupees (don't
though). You want to be stockpiling your rupees constantly because you need
them constantly.

5. Lastly, this game has been around for 30+ years and different people play it
differently. There are many strategies to conquering The Legend of Zelda and
we're going to do this in a more casual, the way it was meant to be played
style. So, we're not going to be doing a get every item for Labyrinth One
strategy, nor will we be heading directly to Labyrinth One.

The strategy outlined in this walkthrough is, in my opinion, the ideal strategy
for the best playing experience to be garnered from this game. I hope you enjoy
The Legend of Zelda and let's dig in:

You will start the game on Coordinate H8. Thankfully, there are no enemies
because you are unarmed! Well, you have a shield. But it's a shitty Wooden
Shield. So, we need to do some prepping.

Head forward to the cave in this coordinate and you'll find an Old Man waiting
inside.

            "I T ' S   D A N G E R O U S   T O   G O   A L O N E!
                            T A K E    T H I S."

The Old Man will give you a -=WOODEN SWORD=-. It's super ineffective! Gee,
thanks, Old Man. Take the sword from the Old Man and exit the Cave. Don't worry
about the sword, we'll get a better one in no time. Now, how to use your
shield: It will block incoming objects from whatever direction so long as you
AREN'T swinging your sword while it hits you. No sword swing = shield up.
That's how it works.

It's from this point that most players choose to go straight to the first
dungeon, but the way I see it: that's just making life more difficult than it
has to be. In a few minutes, we can get some bombs, the blue candle, some heart
containers, a better sword and shield, potions, and the blue ring. Why wouldn't
you do that before jumping into a dungeon, right?

Proceed west from the start to H7 where you'll be confronted by four Tektites.
Kill them from afar with your sword beams (as long as you have full health,
you'll be shooting nice and shiny sword lasers from far away). Take whatever
they drop for you and proceed north to G7. Kill the four Red Octoroks and take
your goodies. Enter the cave here to enter World Shop 1.

And look at that. They have the -=BLUE CANDLE=- in stock. And for only 60
rupees, what a steal! Okay, that may seem steep now, but it's really not that
bad for what you're getting. So, we need to save up 60 rupees. That shouldn't
be too hard.

Return to H8, the starting point, and now we're going to head east until we
can't go east anymore, through H9, H10, H11, H12, H13, H14, H15, and lastly
H16. Kill everything you can along the way. H9 has a squad of Red Octoroks for
you to take care of H10 and H11 have Tektites ready and waiting to perish by
your blade. H12 you'll be attacked by Leevers as soon as you step into the area
and a Zola will fire at you from the water. H13 continues along the beach with
more Leevers as that pesky Zola keeps shooting at you. H14 has a pack of Blue
Octoroks and H15 has (mercifully) Red Octoroks. When you finally reach H16
there will be a single Blue Octorok for you to kill before continuing north to
G16.

Take care of the mixed Red and Blue Octoroks here and head into the cave for
World Shop 2. Here you can buy -=BOMBS=- for 20 rupees if you haven't had any
drop for you yet (it's pretty rare that I don't get bombs to drop for me on the
way, but on the off chance that you don't, the shop is a convenient failsafe).
Drop the 20 rupees if you need to and then exit the shop.

Now just head back and forth between here and H8 and keep killing the enemies
until you have 60 rupees (it shouldn't take long at all, I had 85 rupees after
two passes). (Note: the enemies do respawn, it just takes a little bit. By the
time you've reached the end of the loop, they should be spawning where you came
from.) Alternatively, you can try your luck with the Gambling Game. Head west
one from the origin to H7. Here you want to bomb the north wall 5 tiles to the
left of the north path. Use the map for help.

Inside the cave you've made, the Old Man will present you with three options,
each at -10 rupees. The way the game works is you pick one of the options. Two
of the three subtract rupees while one adds them. If you pick the additive one,
you make a quick buck. Usually, one of the subtractive ones is more damaging
than the other. After you pick, the options will change to show you what they
were. You then have to leave and reenter the cave to reset it. If you run out
of rupees, kill some enemies around here to get more OR save your game before
entering and reset every time you run out.

However you chose to get rupees, return to the shop at coordinate G7 once you
have 60 and purchase the Blue Candle. Hooray! A few minutes and we already have
bombs and the Blue Candle.

Now that we've got bombs and a Blue Candle, it's time we grabbed some extra
Heart Containers. After all that combat, I'm sure you're just itching to no
longer be restricted by your three heart limitations. It's okay, me too.

To get Heart Container 1, return to the origin coordinate (H8). Head east all
the way through to H12 (the first area with water). Kill all the Leevers again
so that there's some peace and quiet (except for that bastard Zola that's still
taking shots from the water like a chump). Equip your bombs and bomb the wall
-=TWO TILES TO THE LEFT OF THE NORTH PATHWAY=- to reveal a hidden cave. Use the
map for help.

Enter the cave to find our good friend the Old Man. You know, the one that gave
you this piece of crap sword. Yep, the very same (we think). He'll give you a
choice between a bottle of red potion and a -=HEART CONTAINER=-. Don't you dare
pick the potion. Grab the Heart Container and return to the Overworld once
more.

From here head North to G12, west to G9, north to E9, and then west to E8.
Equip your Blue Candle and count -=FIVE BUSHES=- from the right and use the
Blue Candle on the fifth bush to reveal a stair way. Use the map to help you.

Head down it to meet our Old Man for the second time. I swear to God, if you
pick the potion, we'll have words. Grab your second -=HEART CONTAINER=- and
return to the Overworld. 

From here head east to E9, then north to C9. Beeline east ignoring the Peahats
and continue east to C13. Kill the four Tektites here and then bomb the -=LOWER
RIGHT SIDE OF THE CENTRAL ROCK FORMATION=- to reveal another cave. Use the map
to help you.

Enter to find the same Old Man and the same choice. I've told you time and
again! Don't take the potion! Grab your third -=HEART CONTATINER=- from the Old
Man. And now you have six hearts. That means we're worthy enough to wield the
White Sword.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we grab the White Sword, it's easier if we make a quick detour now to
grab the Letter. Pop over east once more to C14. Kill the Octoroks if you wish
and then head north along the pathway (not the stairs) to B14. Ignore the
Peahats and the stairs here and head east once more to B15. The stairs HERE are
the ones you need to use, and they will lead you up to A15 where there is a
another cave entrance.

Enter the hole and don't pay the troll toll. Inside will be the Old Man again
and he will tell you to "Show this to the Old Woman." So, grab the -=LETTER=-
and marvel at the Old Man's teleporting abilities before returning once more
to the Overworld. That's all we have to do for this quest right this second.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   S O M E   R E A L   G E A R                                       [101-5]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Return to C13 and head west to C9 and kill all the Leevers on the way. When you
get to C9 head west one more to C8 and then north to B8, ignoring the Peahats
as you go. You now find yourself in the Death Mountain region. Beware of
falling rock.

Move quickly, avoiding the rocks, and head east to B11 (the screen with all the
Tektites and the blue staircase leading up Death Mountain). Avoid the Tektites
(or kill them) and head up the staircase to A11. Here there's a pond in the
center with a Zola in it and a Blue Lynel patrolling the area. Kill or avoid
the Lynel (probably avoid for now) and get into the cave in the upper left
corner of the area. You'll find the Old Man inside once more but this time with
the -=WHITE SWORD=-.

           "M A S T E R   U S I N G   I T   A N D   Y O U   C A N
                            H A V E   T H I S."

Grab the White Sword and rejoice for your sword no longer sucks. This puppy can
one shot most of the little turds you've been hacking away at until now. Now
that we have a better sword, we need a better shield. And my axe!

Now we could head to the shop at G16 and pick one up for 130 rupees, but what
if I told you... that we can get one for 90 rupees? To do so, you need to
backtrack all the way to the origin point (H8). From the origin, head west one,
north one, west one, north one, and then east one to F7. I killed everything on
the way in an attempt to maximize my rupee earnings and made a whopping one
rupee the whole way. So, you decide on that one. However, you do need to make
sure you have 90 rupees when you get to F7, so do that (either by the farming
loop or the gambling cave).

Once you reach F7, head north one more time to E7. Use the Blue Candle on the
-=BUSH IN THE CORNER=- where the path bends to reveal a staircase.  Use the map
for help.

Head down the staircase to find a shop with the Magical Shield for sale at a
price of 90 rupees. Drop your ka-ching on the shield and return to the
Overworld.

Right, so we've got our sword and our shield now. Just a few things left on our
pre-flight checklist here.

Now that we have six hearts, the White Sword, and the Magic Shield, things are
going to be considerably easier. But we can still bump this cake walk up a
notch. To end the Letter quest and unlock the Potion Shops, we need to get to
G5. And while we're over there, we can also shoot up to D5 and grab the Blue
Ring, which halves Link's incoming damage.

There's just one catch: the Blue Ring costs 250 rupees. But the good news is
that we don't have to run the rupee farm loop or gamble like addicts until we
have 250 rupees, there are better ways to make rupees now. You'll notice on the
map that there are a series of rupee gifts hidden throughout Hyrule. You may be
saying, "Hey WTF, Herc? Why didn't we use those before?" Well, cause we needed
them for now. So, we're gonna stop off and grab one of these rupee gifts on the
way to deliver the letter.

We need to get to G12 first, so from E7: head east two, south two, and east
three to G12. Kill the handful of Moblins and Octoroks here and then get your
Blue Candle ready. Burn the -=BOTTOM BUSH=- in the stack of three on the right.
Use the map for help.

Head down the stairs you've unearthed and grab the 100 rupees. Now then, let's
deliver that letter. Head west all the way to G5.

Kill the Octoroks here and then head into the cave. Equip the Letter the Old
Man gave you earlier and give it to the Old Woman inside. You have now unlocked
the ability to buy Potions at a Potion Shop. The Blue Potion costs 40 rupees
and the Red Potion costs 68 rupees. The difference is you can use a Red Potion
twice, so always buy the Red Potions. If you buy a potion right now, you'll
need to make that money back for the Blue Ring.

Now there's one more 100-rupee gift we can get here to help us afford the Blue
Ring. IMPORTANT NOTE: You can either get these 100 rupees now or save it for
just before the Demon Labyrinth (Level 7) where you'll need 100 rupees for a
Bomb Upgrade. Your choice between taking the convenience now or later. If you
plan to skip out on the 100-rupee gift now, jump to the paragraph after the
map.

Head east into the Lost Woods (characterized by brown bushes instead of green)
two screens to G3 and kill the Moblins here. Then burn the -=TOPMOST BUSH=-
in the single column that bisects the screen here and grab the 100 rupees from
inside. Use the map for help.

Now that have 250 rupees, we're trying to get to coordinate D5. So, from the
Potion Shop at G5 just head north three screens and you're there. You should be
in an area with six Armos statues in it. Touch the -=TOP-MIDDLE=- Armos and it
will begin to move around, revealing a staircase where it once stood. Use the

Descend the staircase to find World Shop 4. Here you can purchase the Blue Ring
from the merchant for the low, low price of 250 rupees. Fork over all your hard
earned rupees and get the Blue Ring. Now that you've got your fancy blue
(white, though) tunic, we're ready for the first Labyrinth.

Return south three screens to G5, then east to G9, and then north to D9. Cross
the bridge to D8 where you'll find the entrance to the Eagle Labyrinth.

-- F3 - Immediately upon entering you're faced with three doors. The door
leading north is locked, so head right to F4 first.

-- F4 - You'll find yourself faced with a group of five Stalfos. Eliminate them
all and one will drop a -=KEY=-. Take the key then return to F3.

-- F3 - Head left now to F2.

-- F2 - Kill the three Keese flying around the room and a second -=KEY=- will
appear. Grab it and return to F3 again.

-- F3 - Now we can head further into the Labyrinth. Use one of your keys on the
north door and head through.

-- E3 - There will be three Stalfos in here. Dispatch them easily enough and
proceed north again to D3.

-- D3 - Another big group of Stalfos await you in this room. Kill them all and
another -=KEY=- will appear. Grab the new key and head right to D4.

-- D4 - Kill all of the Keese in this room and grab the nice and shiny
-=COMPASS=- sitting on the floor. Return back to D3.

-- D3 - Head across and left to D2.

-- D2 - As you enter this room, the door will barricade behind you. There are a
lot of Keese in here so kill them quickly and pick up whatever they drop. Once
all are dead, the door to D3 will reopen. Ignore it for now and go north
through the locked door, using one of your keys.

-- C2 - Kill the three Gels in here to give yourself some breathing room.
You'll notice that once the Gels are dead, the barricade to your left doesn't
open. Hmm. There's a -=SINGULAR BLOCK=- in the middle of the room. Push it to
the right and the barricade will open. Head through the new door.

-- C1 - There will be an Old Man here and he'll give you a hint.

             "E A S T M O S T   P E N N I N S U L A   I S   T H E
                                S E C R E T ."

You'll note that they misspelled "peninsula" (in the Switch version this is
fixed and spelled properly). That's all from the Old Man so head back to C2.

-- C2 - Head across and to the right to C3.

-- C3 - Kill all of the Gels in here and then grab the -=MAP=-. Not that you
really needed it since I've provided you with one at the start. Still, it's
nice to have a quick reference of your whereabouts. Once you have the map,
head north through the open door.

-- B3 - You will find yourself in a water-filled room with a single pathway
tracing around it. There are three Stalfos on the pathway. Kill them all and
grab the -=KEY=- that one of them drops. Continue north through the locked
door.

-- A3 - There are three Goriyas here throwing their boomerangs all willy-nilly.
Approach them carefully and take them out and a -=KEY=- will appear. Take the
key and continue through the locked door to your left.

-- A2 - Watch out for the Traps as soon as you enter! You'll notice immediately
in this room a staircase surrounded by blocks. You need to push the -=LEFTMOST
BLOCK=- up to access the staircase.

                      _
                    _|_|_           KEY:
                  _|_| |_|_
                 |P|  S  | |        P - Push Block
                  ¯|¯| |¯|¯         S - Stairs
                    ¯|¯|¯
                      ¯

Once you've gained access to the stairs, head down them to a basement room.
Kill off the four Keese in here and then grab the -=BOW=- from the platform on
the right. Once you have the Bow, return up the stairs to A2 and back track to
C3.

-- C3 - Head through the locked door to the right now, using your last key for
now.

-- C4 - In this next room are three more Goriyas flinging their boomerangs
every which way. Kill them and a -=BOOMERANG=- of your very own will appear at
the top of the room. Pick it up and continue right to C5.

-- C5 - Watch out for the Wall Masters in here! You'll need to grab the -=KEY=-
in this room while avoiding the Wall Masters and if they grab you, they'll take
you all the way back to the beginning of the Labyrinth. Once you have the key,
hurry north through the locked door.

  |  Attacks:                                                               |
  |  - Shoots a burst of three fireballs at you. Each fireball does a       |
  |    half heart of damage with the Blue Ring equipped                     |
  |  - That's it.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Strategy:                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you have full heart containers going into the fight, just sit in  |
  |    the back and shoot sword beams at him. He'll die after a few hits.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - The other strategy is to wait for him to fire a volley of fireballs, |
  |    dodge the projectiles, and then run up close and slash him. In my    |
  |    opinion, this is quicker and easier than shooting sword beams.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you have the White Sword (which you should), he'll die after      |
  |    three hits.                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Beyond shooting fireballs, he barely even moves. He's a very         |
  |    stationary boss, so use that to your advantage when going in for     |
  |    the kill.                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Aquamentus is a very easy boss (not surprising considering he's the    |
  |  first boss of the game. Shoot him with sword beams or wait for         |
  |  fireball volley and run up to slash him. You should be able to kill    |
  |  him without much fuss and get on to other things.                      |
   \_______________________________________________________________________/
  
Once Aquamentus has fallen, grab the -=HEART CONTAINER=- he leaves behind and
head through the door to the right. Grab the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- here and
you'll get a nice little animation and be conveniently teleported to exiting
the Labyrinth and that's it. Eagle Labyrinth complete!

There's not too much to do besides heading straight for the Moon Labyrinth. I'd
suggest picking up a Red Potion if you don't have one just in case and then
we're off.

We need to navigate to coordinate D13. Back track to the origin (H8) and head
all the way east until you can't go east anymore (H16). Now head north one
screen and then west two screens. Follow the path north two screens and then
head west one screen. There will be five Octoroks here and a flight of stairs
leading north. Kill the Octoroks and take the stairs up to the entrance of the
Moon Labyrinth.

-- H2 - Starting out, you have two choices: up or right. Head right into H3.

-- H3 - You'll be confronted by a pack of roaming Ropes. Take them all out
(careful, they move really fast) and a -=KEY=- will appear in the center of the
room. Grab the key and head up through the next door.

-- G3 - Kill the handful of Ropes here and head through the left door.

-- G2 - More Ropes. Kill them back, Guardian. Once they're all dead the door to
the left will open. Proceed through it.

-- G1 - Kill all the Ropes in here and grab the -=KEY=- they were guarding.
Once you have the key head back right all the way to G3.

-- G3 - Using one of your new keys, unlock the door to the right and head
through it.

-- G4 - Kill all of the Gels in here to get them out of your way and then grab
the -=COMPASS=- from the corner. Now equip your bombs and bomb the top wall
(from here on out: when I say to bomb a wall in a Labyrinth, I mean to bomb the
middle of that wall. It's always going to be the middle of the wall where a
door would be in Labyrinths) to create a passageway to F4. Head through it.

-- F4 - Take out the gels in here and then pick up the -=MAP=- in the center of
the room. Now bomb the top wall in here as well. Head through the new door.

-- E4 - E4 is a terrible, terrible place. There will be three Blue Goriyas in
the middle of the room throwing their boomerangs like mad and accompanying them
in the four corners of the room are four Stone Statues peppering you constantly
with fireballs. If you can make it out of here without taking damage, you're a
god. Kill the three Goriyas and the -=MAGICAL BOOMERANG=- will appear in the
center of the room. Grab it and leave immediately through the door on the left.

-- E3 - Upon entering this room, the door to the south will slam shut. Kill the
Ropes in here and pick up whatever they drop. When all of them are defeated,
the lower door will open and a -=KEY=- will appear. Grab the key. Now, if you
want, you can head south to F3 and kill all the Goriyas in there for hearts if
you need them, but there are a lot so be careful (and this way you don't have
to unlock the door between F3 and F4). Once you're ready to proceed, head up
to D3.

-- D3 - Now we've got a desert room and extra special just for you: two
Moldorms. Slash the Moldorms to bits (they're easy) and once they're both
defeated, a -=KEY=- will appear. Grab the key and then head to the right.

-- D4 - Watch out for the Traps! Kill the few Keese in here and then grab the
-=BOMBS=- from this room. If you were bombing the walls like I told you to,
then you need to replenish your supply. Now head back to D3 and then up to C3.

-- C3 - There's a ton of Ropes in here so dispatch them as quickly as you can.
Maybe you'll get lucky and one of them will drop a Stopwatch. Once they've all
been defeated the top door will open but before we head through there, proceed
to the right through the locked door.

-- C4 - Kill the five Gels in here and five rupees will appear in the middle of
the room. Pick that up and then head north to B4.

-- B4 - We've found the Old Man again and he'll once more give us a clue.

              "D O D O N G O   D I S L I K E S   S M O K E ."

This one is much less cryptic than the peninsula one. He's simply telling us a
mechanic for the upcoming boss fight. Say bye to the Old Man and head back down
then left to C3.

-- C3 - Now head north through the other door to B3.

-- B3 - This is the last room we'll hang out in before fighting the Dodongo.
It's also full of Goriyas. Use the blocks in the room to your advantage and
kill all of the Goriyas. Take whatever they drop and once you've killed them
all some more bombs will appear in the upper right corner of the room. Grab
them if you need them and then suck in your gut cause we got a boss to kill.

And just like that we're already fighting the next boss. Now I hope you're
ready for a fight this time cause... well, Dodongo is also pretty easy. Let's
bomb his butt (literally).

  |  "A giant rhinoceros. It hasn't got so much    | Received:              |
  |  attacking power, but it bounces off attacks   |  -- Heart Container    |
  |  with its thick hide"                          |  -- Triforce Piece 2   |
  |                                                |                        |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Attacks:                                                               |
  |  - Just like the description says, the Dodongo doesn't have much        |
  |    attacking power, in that it doesn't attack at all.                   |
  |  - He just walks around the room.                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Strategy:                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - The Dodongo is impervious to everything in your arsenal except bombs |
  |    but you probably guessed that cause the Labyrinth gave you bombs     |
  |    twice and you were smart enough to figure out the Old Man's clue.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - As the Dodongo walks around the room, lay a bomb in its path. As it  |
  |    walks over the bomb, it will eat it and then the bomb will explode   |
  |    inside it. Do this twice and the Dodongo will perish.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If for whatever reason the Dodongo doesn't eat your bomb, the smoke  |
  |    will still stun it (this is what the Old Man was talking about) and  |
  |    you can run up and slash him to bits during that window.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Dodongo is probably the easiest boss in this game. Drop bombs in his   |
  |  path twice or stun him with smoke and hack away with your sword. This  |
  |  is an easy win so dispatch him and I'll see you on the other side.     |

Hey! You beat Dodongo! Good job. Pretty tough, right? Once he's dead grab the
-=HEART CONTAINER=- he leaves behind for you and head through the door to the
left. Grab the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- here and you'll be teleported to the
Labyrinth entrance. Moon Labyrinth complete!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's not much to do after beating the Moon Labyrinth other than head to the
Manji Labyrinth, and by not much I mean nothing at all. The Manji Labyrinth
entrance is at coordinate H5, which is right next to the origin coordinate.
Unfortunately, it's not as simple as just heading west from the origin.

So, make your way back to H8 and then head west once, north once, west three
(grab a potion from the Old Lady if you need), and west once more into G4 and
the Lost Woods. Immediately head south one then east one to H5 where you will
find the entrance to the Manji Labyrinth. Enter if you dare.

-- F4 - Starting out there's only one possible way to go, so head left to F3.

-- F3 - There are several Zols in this room (just larger versions of Gels), but
they won't be an issue since we already have the White Sword. You'll also
notice a -=KEY=- in the middle of the room. Kill the Zols, making sure to grab
whatever they drop, and grab the key. Continue up to E3.

-- E3 - Another pack of Zols awaits you here, so dispatch them and they'll drop
another -=KEY=-. Grab the key and continue the only way you can go: up to D3.

-- D3 - There are three Darknuts here for you to face. You cannot damage them
from head-on thanks to their shields, so get behind them or beside them before
slashing. If you have full health, sword beams make landing shots on them a lot
easier. Bombs can also be useful. Once they're defeated, they'll drop some
-=BOMBS=- for you. Grab them if you want and then head left to D2.

-- D2 - Watch out for the Traps when you enter! You'll notice the -=COMPASS=-
in the middle of the room here and some Keese. Kill the Keese and then grab the
Compass. Use one of your keys on the door to the left and head into D1.

-- D1 - In here there will be six more Darknuts. Eliminate them however you
choose and once they're all dead, the door to the south will open. Head south
to E1.

-- E1 - Welcome to yet another room with a metric ton of Darknuts. Dispatch
them however you can. They tend to drop a lot of bombs, so I'd recommend using
bombs to clear a few of them out before switching to hack 'n' slashing the
rest. Grab what you can and then head down the stairs to the basement. In the
basement, head down the stairs killing the Keese as you go. Once the Keese are
taken care of, grab the -=RAFT=- from the platform to the right and then return
up the stairs. Once back on the main floor, head up twice to C1.

-- C1 - In here there will be two Zols, a few Keese, and three Bubbles. You
can't damage the Bubbles with your sword so tend to the other enemies then grab
the -=KEY=- from the center of the room and exit to the right.

-- C2 - Entering this room from the left restricts you to a narrow path through
the center of the room. Kill the Keese and a bomb drop will spawn in the path.
Grab the bombs if you need and then continue through the locked door to the
right.

-- C3 - Now we are in one of the centermost rooms for this Labyrinth, which
presents a lot of options for where to go next. First things first, kill the
three Zols in here and grab the -=KEY=- that spawns once they're dead. Now, we
can rule out going South since we've already been to D3. So, we've got up or to
the right. We're going to head up first, so use a key on the top door and head
through.

-- B3 - Watch out for Traps as you enter! There are two Zols in here to go
ahead and take them out. Now then, the door ahead is blocked, and we have two
blocks in here. Push the left block one more space to the left and the door
will open. Continue upward.

-- A3 - Here we'll encounter the Old Man once more with another hint for us.

         "D I D   Y O U   G E T   T H E   S W O R D   F R O M   T H E
                   O L D   M A N   O N   T O P   O F   T H E
                             W A T E R F A L L ?"

He's referring to the White Sword here and we've had that for quite some time.
Move on through the door to the left.

-- A2 - The door will promptly close behind you as you enter, and you'll be
trapped with a number of Keese. Kill them all and grab the -=KEY=- in this
room. Now then, backtrack to our central room: C3.

-- C3 - Now we're going to through the locked door to the right.

-- C4 - Watch out for the Traps as you enter! Kill the Zols in the center of
the room here and grab the -=MAP=-. Why they put the map so far in this
Labyrinth is beyond me, but we don't really need it anyway, so no big deal.
Now, we're about to face Manhandla. If you like, you can head down one to D4
and kill the enemies there for some rupees or a chance at some health. Whenever
you're read bomb the right wall here and step through to the boss's chamber.

Clap the chalk off your hands because we're breezing through this game. Now I
hope you're actually ready for a fight this time cause... well, Manhandla is
pretty easy too. Let's give him a slap.

  |  "A large man-eating flower with hands         | Received:              |
  |  sticking out in all four directions. It moves |  -- Heart Container    |

  |  - It'll charge at you with flailing arms and give you a good whack.    |
  |  - It also shoots fireballs from every orifice, of which there are a    |
  |    good number.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Strategy:                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - There's one surefire way to kill the Manhandla with a single blow.   |
  |    You need to drop a bomb in its path in just the right way that it    |
  |    will explode when the Manhandla is centered on it. This will blow    |
  |    all of its limbs off in one fell swoop and that'll be that. You need |
  |    to be accurate with your bombs. It's much easier said than done.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - The actual strategy here is to hack off its limbs with your sword    |
  |    (two hits per limb with the White Sword). It'll speed up as you      |
  |    delimb it until all of its arms have been cut off.                   |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Summary:                                                               |

  |  Manhandla is a real slapper. Try to nail it with a bomb in dead center |
  |  to blow all its limbs off or hack away at the arms with your sword.    |
  |  It shouldn't give you too much trouble.                                |

And just like that, another one bites the dust. Once he's dead grab the -=HEART
CONTAINER=- he leaves behind for you and head through the door to above. Grab
the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- here and you'll be teleported to the Labyrinth entrance.
Manji Labyrinth complete!

Head back to the origin point (H8) by going west one, north one, east four,
south one. And you're back. This time we do actually have some small errands to
take care of before we jump on into the Snake Labyrinth.

From origin, head all the way east to H16. From H16 head north one screen to
G16. Head into the store here and drop some rupees on a bundle of arrows and
have your Bow equipped. Now then: head north three screens (ignore the Heart
Container at F16, we need the Stepladder for it) and you'll be at D16 where the
beach makes a corner and you should see a -=DOCK=-. Walk straight to the dock
and keep walking as if you were going to pull a Jesus and walk on the water.
The Raft will appear automagically and take you across the water to a secret
cave at C16 (it looks like a Labyrinth entrance but it's not).

Head into the cave to find the Old Man again with the choice between a potion
and a -=HEART CONTAINER=-. Oh fine. You can pick the potion. EXCEPT NOT. Get
the Heart Container, you fool. Exit the cave and head back to the mainland,
then retrace your steps all the way back to the origin. From there, head north
one, then west all the way to the screen with the Potion Shop (G5), then north
three to the area with the Armos statues and the secret store where we bought
the Blue Ring.

Move the Armos again and go into the store. Buy the -=MONSTER BAIT=- from the
Merchant for 60 rupees and then return to the Overworld. Now head back south
to G5 (where the Potion Shop is) and head east one screen and then cross the
bridge. Head north immediately after crossing the bridge and walk off the dock.
The Raft will take you straight to the island where the Snake Labyrinth awaits
you. Enter.

-- H2 - You'll start once more at the bottom of the Labyrinth, so we'll be
working our way up. Before heading that way through, shoot left to H1.

-- H1 - Kill all of the Keese in here and a -=KEY=- will appear. Grab the Key
and return to H2 before heading up to G2.

-- G2 - There will be three Vire in this room. Hit them to split them into Red
Keese and then pick off the Keese. One thing to be aware of with Vire is they
respawn every time you enter the room, unlike enemies from Labyrinth's past.
Once the room is cleared, use a key on the locked door to the right and head
through.

-- G3 - This room is very dark and contains obstacles that you cannon see.
You'll notice the -=COMPASS=- in the middle of the room and quite a few Vire
hopping about the room. You can use the Blue Candle to light these dark rooms
up, and there's about to be a lot of them. Kill the Vire and grab the Compass
and then make your way out of the maze and head to G2.

-- G2 - Kill the three Vire again and then head up through the next door.

-- F2 - Make Tippi proud and kill the swarm of Keese in this room. Pick up
whatever they drop and grab the -=KEY=- here. Proceed left to F1.

-- F1 - It's another dark room teeming with Vire who are conveniently not
bound by the obstacles that restrict you. Kill the Vire and continue through
the door at the top.

-- E1 - Another dark room, this time full of Zols. Kill the Zols and grab the
-=KEY=- in the middle of the room. Proceed through the door at the top.

-- D1 - And yet another dark room. Are we having fun yet? This time you've got
two Bubbles and three Vire to deal with. Once you've killed the Vire, we can't
go through the top door yet, so head through the locked door on the right.

-- D2 - LET THERE BE LIGHT! Finally, a room we don't have to light up. We've
got a room full of water, a singular path through it, and four Vire hopping
along that path. Take out the Vire one by one and once you've killed
everything, the door to the right will open.

-- D3 - Here we have two Bubbles, two Zols, and two Like Likes. This is our
first time encountering the Like Like, so be warned: if they touch you, they
will take your shield and you will not get it back unless you buy a new one. So
attack them with caution. Kill the Zols just to give yourself some breathing
room and then take notice of the two blocks in here. Push the leftmost block
one space to the left to reveal a staircase in the top right corner of the
room. Head down to the basement level. Kill the four Keese and then grab the
-=STEPLADDER=- from the platform on the right. Head back upstairs and go left
all the way over to D1.

-- D1 - You'll have to kill the Vire again. And now that we have the Stepladder
we can cross over the water gap. Head straight up to cross the gap and go
through the locked door to C1.

-- C1 - You can either kill the Vires here or ignore them, we just need to head
through the door to the right.

-- C2 - We're in another dark room and this one has the -=MAP=- in the bottom
right corner. Light the room up with the Blue Candle and skirt your way around
the edge of the room. As you can see, had we gone through the locked door in
D2, we'd have wasted a key and had to go around anyway. Once you have the map,
navigate back around the wall and bomb the top wall to create a doorway. Head
through to B2.

-- B2 - Here's a nice little rupee gift for you. Grab all the rupees and then
bomb the left wall and head through the new doorway to B1.

-- B1 - You'll immediately be assaulted by a Manhandla here. I guess it's a
miniboss? Fight it (don't forget that sweet bomb strategy) and kill it. Once
it's dead, the doors will open. Head through the top door to A1.

-- A1 - We've found the Old Man room and he's ready with another hint.

             "W A L K   I N T O   T H E   W A T E R F A L L ."

This is in reference to the waterfall at B11, the same waterfall above which we
got the White Sword. There's a cave there where you can pay the Old Man for a
hint. With that over with, use a key on the locked door to your right and head
to A2.

-- A2 - This room is dark again, though the Blue Candle isn't as necessary now
that we have the stepladder and can traverse these rooms as if there were no
gabs. Kill all of the Keese and grab the -=KEY=- from the middle of the room
before proceeding through the door to the right.

-- A3 - Watch out for the Traps as you enter! Skirt around the Traps and head
through the door at the bottom of the room.

-- B3 - There will be a lot more Vire (man, they really loved those guys for
this Labyrinth) so kill them off and then pay mind to the two blocks. You
should know what to do. Push the leftmost block left and the door to the right
will open. Head through to the boss chamber.

It's that time again, the fourth boss of the game. Now I really hope you're
actually ready for a fight cause... well, Gleeok is also pretty easy. Let's get
ahead of him.

  |                                                                         |
  |  Attacks:                                                               |
  |  - In this specific case we're dealing with a two-head Gleeok. The two  |
  |    heads will shoot fireballs at you.                                   |
  |  - Once you separate a head, the head will turn red and fly around the  |
  |    room shooting fireballs at you.                                      |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Strategy:                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Make sure you've got a decent bit of health going into the fight.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you have full health, use your sword beams from range to do the   |
  |    bulk of the work.                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you don't, you'll have to get in close and just trade blows with  |
  |    him. Be consistent with your attacks and Gleeok will die before you  |
  |    do.                                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - I know that's not much of a strategy but don't blame me, blame the   |
  |    game designers.                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Gleeok is basically just a multi-headed, more annoying version of      |
  |  Aquamentus. Use your sword beams from range if you have full health,   |
  |  otherwise get in close and trade blows with it. You should be coming   |
  |  out the other side in no time.                                         |
   \_______________________________________________________________________/
  
It may not have been pretty, but that double-headed dick is in the dirt. Once
it's dead, grab the -=HEART CONTAINER=- from the corner and head through the
door at the top. Grab the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- here and you'll be teleported to
the Labyrinth entrance. Snake Labyrinth complete!

Look at you. You're already halfway through the game. Four Labyrinths down,
four more to go. We'll be kicking Ganon in the nards before you know it. Now,
there are some things we can get to make our lives even more easy, so we'll
take a brief interlude from the Labyrinth smashing and run some worldly
errands.

Alright. First things first, let's get that last Heart Container. We already
know where it is (F16), so let's make our way there. I promise you the path is
just so much easier to return to origin (H8) and head hard east like we have
repeatedly. The central squares are just so maze-like that you can easily get
twisted up sometimes. If you do decide to try and beeline it, take the raft
down and head hard east immediately. Stick to the top of the screen as you
progress through each grid because eventually you'll hit a screen where the top
half is separated. Once you reach the third screen with Moblins, take the
right-most path south. From here, you can push east to G16 and then up to F16.

Or just go to origin and do it that way. However you do it, once you get to
F16, clear out the Octoroks and use the Stepladder to cross the water and grab
-=HEART CONTAINER 5=-. And that's the last of the Overworld Heart Containers.
Now, count your hearts. You should have 12, which means we can get the Magical
Sword now! But first, we're going to grab the Power Bracelet since it's
somewhat on the way.

   I   H A V E   T H E   P O W E R !                                 [106-2]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Return to origin and make your way to the Potion Shop (G5). Now would be a good
time to buy some potion. Head west one screen to enter the Lost Woods and now
we're gonna cross it. So, head south first to H4. Take the bottom path west to
H3. There's not much else to do here but continue west to H2, so do that. Be
warned the Moblins can throw their spears through the bushes.

You'll be in a rocky area, so immediately head north and you'll be back in the
Lost Woods. Now then, this part of the Lost Woods is famously annoying. You
have to navigate it in a certain pattern or else you'll never get out of it.
The code to remember is ULDL, which means Up, Left, Down, Left. And you'll
quickly notice that each screen is the same. So, head up, then left, then down,
then left (or north, west, south, west). You'll know you've done it properly
when you get the Zelda puzzle solved chime and it spits you out in a new area
(coordinate F1). There are Lynels EVERYWHERE. Just avoid them for the most part
and head north to exit the Lost Woods and enter the Hyrule Graveyard.

Head north again up the stairs to a screen with actual tombstones. Ignore the
Ghinis (ghost guys floating around) and go east one, north one, and east one to
exit the Graveyard. Kill the Lynels here (arrows are your friend) and head east
another screen. Here we have a dozen Armos Statues and two staircases leading
up the mountain. Head up the staircase on the right and then head east one
screen and you'll find another arrangement of a dozen Armos Statues. We are now
at coordinate C5, which is where the Power Bracelet is located. Awaken the
Armos all the way on the right in the top row and the -=POWER BRACELET=- will
be underneath him. Use the map for help.

Take your prize and enjoy your newfound strength. Now there's just one more
thing to do and it's nearby, fortunately.

Now that we have 12 hearts, it's time to upgrade our sword once again. Make
your way back down the stairs and all the way west until you're back in the
Graveyard. Go north one screen and we're in the right coordinate (C2). The
tombstone you are looking for is middle row, third column. Use the map for
help.

Push the Tombstone up one space to reveal a staircase. Don't touch any other
Tombstones or it will spawn more Ghinis that can only be killed if you kill the
first Ghini!! Head on down to find the Old Man once more with another sword.

           "M A S T E R   U S I N G   I T   A N D   Y O U   C A N
                            H A V E   T H I S."

Take the Magical Sword off his hands and rejoice, for you've just doubled your
attack power! Now that we have the Magical Sword and all our other fixins, it's
time to tackle more Labyrinths.

Return to the origin point (trust me, Cage, it's the only way). When you get to
the Lost Woods part, just go north, east, south, east, north, east and you'll
be at the Potion Shop screen. From the origin point, go east one and then north
as far as you can go to C9 (with all the Peahats). BEFORE HEADING TO THE
LABYRINTH, let's make a quick detour. Head east to C14 (one past where we got
the third Heart Container), head north to B14 and then east two to B16. There's
a cave in a tree here (it's another Gambling Den) and a bunch of Peahats.
Ignore the cave and step one tile to the right of the tree and then walk up and
you'll take a secret staircase north into A16. Use the map for help.

There's a cave on this screen as well. Head into the cave and grab the 100
rupees from inside. -=YOU NEED THESE 100 RUPEES SO MAKE SURE YOU EITHER DO THIS
OR HAVE 100 RUPEES=-. Now then backtrack all the way to C9 and then head west,
then north (and remember to watch out for falling Rocks as we make our way into
Death Mountain territory), then east until the screen starts repeating itself
(B12, a group of 10 rocks in the center with stairs leading up and stairs
leading down). Take the stairs up for four screens and you'll hear the puzzle
chime again and be face-to-face with the entrance to the Lizard Labyrinth. So,
go on in.

-- H3 - You have two options here. Head to the right.

-- H4 - We have a new enemy to take down in this room: Pols Voice. Don't know
what the name has to do with the enemy but it's basically a bouncing rabbit's
head. And boy does it pack a wallop. Even with the Blue Ring, it'll ding you
for a full heart if you get hit. The Bow is excellent against them but
unfortunately, we need our rupees for now. So, toil away hacking them to death
with a sword and grab the -=KEY=- that drops once they're all dead. Now, bomb
the top wall and head through the hole.

-- G4 - It's the Old Man, and he's got a clue for us again.

           "D I G D O G G E R   H A T E S   C E R T A I N   K I N D S
                              O F   S O U N D ."

It's a nice hint for how to beat the boss considering the item we'll be getting
momentarily, but we'll get to that later. You'll notice that there's a locked
door to the left. If you've followed this guide the whole way, you should have
2 keys right now, because we had more than we needed in the Moon Labyrinth. So,
feel free to pop on through that locked door, or go all the way back around
through the Entrance screen if you'd like to save a key. Either way, get to G3.

-- G3 - Use the Blue Candle in here to turn the lights on. Across the partition
of water are some new enemies: Gibdos. They're basically just shambling mummies
that take a couple whacks with the sword a piece. Cross the water and cut them
down and grab the -=KEY=- that drops from one of them. Before continuing
through the door at the top, bomb the left wall and head through the opening.

-- G2 - There are another five Gibdos in here to deal with. Dispatch them
however you choose. One of them should drop some bombs, so make sure to pick
those up. Once they're all dead, the top door will still be sealed. And none of
these blocks do anything so don't bother trying. Instead bomb the left wall and
continue through the hole.

-- G1 - Enjoy the five Darknuts in this cramped space, it's a blast. Kill them
all with extreme prejudice and then focus your attention on the blocks. Push
the leftmost block up and go down the stairs. Kill the four Keese down in the
basement and then head up the other staircase which will take you to coordinate
A3.

-- A3 - There are two locked doors in here. We'll start with the one on the
left. Spend a key and head through the door.

-- A2 - Toil away in combat against the overwhelming number of Darknuts in here
and once you've killed them all, push the only block in the room up to reveal
a staircase in the corner of the room. Head down it. Kill the four Keese in the
basement and grab the -=RECORDER=- from the platform on the right. Return to A2
and head back right to A3.

-- A3 - Now we'll head down through the other locked door to B3.

-- B3 - Kill the swarm of Keese in this next room and grab the -=KEY=- that
rests at the center. Now bomb the right wall and head through the opening.

-- B4 - Here's the Old Man again, only this time he's not giving us a useless
hint. He's selling an upgrade to our bomb carrying capacity. Give him the 100
rupees I said to make sure you have, and your bomb capacity will be increased
to 12. He'll also do you a solid and replenish your bomb supply. Now backtrack
to the stairs and return to coordinate G1.

-- G1 - Ignore the five Darknuts here unless you just like pain and head back
through the hole in the right wall.

-- G2 - Kill the Gibdos here for a decent chance at hearts or rupees and then
head through the right wall again.

-- G3 - Kill the three Gibdos in here and the top door will open for us. It's
time to finally head through that door.

-- F3 - Get ready for another Miniboss. We're facing three Dodongos, but
remember they're a piece of cake and it's nothing to worry about. Just drop
your bombs in their path and watch as they blow themselves open. Remember that
you can slash them to death if your bomb misses slightly but the smoke stuns
them. Two bombs per Dodongo does them in and you should have plenty of bombs to
kill them all. Once they're all defeated, pick up any more bombs that you can
and go through the door to the left.

-- F2 - Cross the strip of water and kill all of the Zols in here. Once they're
all dead, a -=KEY=- will appear. Grab the key and return through the right
door.

-- F3 - Now use a key on the locked door at the top and head through to E3.

-- E3 - Use the Blue Candle to light the place up so you can see, though to be
honest it's not entirely necessary. Grab the map and then head back down to F3.

-- F3 - And lastly, head through the door on the right to F4.

-- F4 - Use the Blue Candle again to light up this room. Kill all the Zols and
a five-rupee piece will appear in the middle of the room. Grab it and then head
through the door at the top.

-- E4 - There are five Gibdos wandering around in here. Kill them all and a
-=KEY=- will appear for you. Grab the key and then continue through the door at
the top.

-- D4 - Use the Blue Candle immediately to light the room up. There are three
Darknuts in here that you need to kill. Use the Stepladder to move in between
the sections of walkway and get easy angles on the Darknuts. When they've all
been killed, the -=COMPASS=- will appear in the center of the room. Grab the
Compass and continue through the door at the top.

-- C4 - There are two Pols Voices, two Gibdos, and two Keese in here for you to
slay. Feel free to use arrows to make the Pols Voices easier now that we've
gotten the bomb upgrade. So, give your enemies the ol' one-two and then grab
the -=KEY=- in the center of the room (if you didn't while fighting) and head
through the locked door to the left.

-- C3 - Kill the five Gibdos in here and grab the -=KEY=- that spawns on the
island once they're dead. Continue through the door to the left.

-- C2 - This is our last room before the boss! Kill the five Pols Voices (one
shots with arrows, don't forget) and then use a key on the locked door to the
left. Head through it to face Digdogger!

If at this point you're starting to feel like none of these bosses' names fit
them, well you're not alone. Now I really do genuinely hope that you are
seriously ready for a fight this time cause... well, Digdogger is pretty easy.
Let's dig up some dirt on him.

  |  "Big sea urchins. In spite of their big       | Received:              |

  |  - Digdogger doesn't really have any attacks, it just constantly moves  |
  |    around the room. If it touches you, it will do damage.               |
  |  - Also watch out for the four statues in the corner that will be       |
  |    continuously shooting fire at you                                    |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Strategy:                                                              |

  |  - Digdogger's strategy makes him one of the easiest bosses in the      |
  |    game. Make sure you have your Recorder equipped and play it during   |
  |    the fight.                                                           |

  |  - The Recorder melody will cause Digdogger to shrivel up to a tiny,    |
  |    much less threatening size. Once he's been shrunk down, two slashes  |
  |    with the Magical Sword will take him out.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Digdogger moves pretty fast once it's been shrunk down. You can use  |
  |    the Boomerang to stun it and keep it in place while you whack at it. |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - You'll need to be evading the Stone Statue fireballs the entire      |
  |    time, cause they'll just keep peppering you. They're honestly a      |
  |    bigger threat that Digdogger.                                        |

  |  Digdogger is a giant floating booger and a scaredy-cat. Play your      |
  |  Recorder to shrink it down and then hit it with a Boomerang and hack   |
  |  it to bits. A quick jam session and you'll be outta there in no time.  |
   \_______________________________________________________________________/
  
Well that was a tasty jam, but Digdogger didn't think so. Once it's dead, grab
the -=HEART CONTAINER=- from the corner and head through the door at the top
(don't worry about the door at the bottom, there's nothing in there). Grab the
-=TRIFORCE PIECE=- and you'll be teleported to the Labyrinth entrance. Lizard
Labyrinth complete!

We only have three more Triforce Pieces left to get. We're almost there, I feel
it in my plums. There's not much to do other than head straight for The Dragon
Labyrinth, so let's get to it. First things first, head down the stairs from
the entrance. Go immediately west when you get to the looping room to be back
at B11 with the Tektites and the Zola. Push west to B8 and cross the river with
the Stepladder to B7. Head west one more screen to B6 and take either of the
two staircases going south to C6. Once down them go west two screens to C4,
down some more stairs to D4, west one screen to D3, and then north up some
stairs to get to the Dragon Labyrinth entrance at coordinate C3. Kill the Lynel
up here if you want and then head into the Labyrinth.

-- H2 - Once inside, immediately head right through the only open door in the
entrance.

-- H3 - Use the Blue Candle right away so you can see what's going on. There
will be a new type of enemy in here for you to do battle with: Wizzrobes, and
four of them. They are the worst enemy in this game (yes, even worse than
Darknuts). They teleport around the room shooting magic beams at you (that do a
ton of damage. The good part is they only shoot the magic beam after they
teleport and it's pretty easy to predict it and get out of the way in time then
give them a slash before they disappear again. Just play patient and kill them
one-by-one. One they're all dead, a -=KEY=- will appear. Grab the key and head
up through the locked door.

-- G3 - It's the Old Man again and he has some more words for you.

             "A I M   A T   T H E   E Y E S   O F   G O H M A ."

It's a pretty simple one here. Gohma is the boss of this dungeon and her eyes
are her weak point. But for now, head back down to the entrance and now go left
through the locked door.

-- H1 - There will be some more Wizzrobes in here for you to kill. Defeat them
all and grab whatever then head up through the only other door.

-- G1 - Sometimes, after all the Wizzrobes and Darknuts, it's nice to just get
a room full of Zols. Kill all the Zols in here and the -=COMPASS=- will appear
in the center of the room. Grab it and continue up through the next door.

-- F1 - There will be a swarm of Keese in here and four Stone Statues in each
corner of the room. Dodge fireballs (poorly, if you're anything like me) while
you kill all of the Keese. Grab the -=KEY=- that drops after killing the last
Keese and head up through the next door.

-- E1 - Watch out for the Traps in this room! Just beeline straight up through
the next door and you should be fine.

-- D1 - Okay, this room is batshit. You've got two Red Wizzrobes, two Blue
Wizzrobes, three Like Likes, and two Bubbles. Avoid the Bubbles like the plague
since they'll render you incapable of using your sword for a few seconds.
Target the Wizzrobes first and try to get them out of the way. Once the
Wizzrobes have been dispatched, turn your attention to the Like Likes. Remember
to play keep away with these guys while you whittle them down, one touch and
your shield is gone. Just pray that one of them drops a Stopwatch. One they're
all dead (well, not the Bubble of course), push the leftmost block one space to
the left to open the doors. Continue up through the next door.

-- C1 - This room has more Wizzrobes and a tone of blocks to restrict your
movement while they can phase right through them. Kill them all and a five-
rupee piece will appear in the top right corner of the room. Instead of heading
up through the next door, bomb the right wall and move through the hole.

-- C2 - There's a bunch of Wizzrobes in here and it's dark. Use the Blue Candle
to light up the room. Kill all of the Wizzrobes (we'll come back through here
so it's best to just kill them now) and then grab the -=KEY=- from the island.
Use a key to head up through the locked door.

-- B2 - There's two Zols, two Bubbles, and two Like Likes in here. Take out the
Zols and the Like Likes and the -=MAP=- will drop. Grab the Map and then head
up through the locked door.

-- A2 - More Wizzrobes, yippee! Seriously, they suck ass. Kill them as fast as
you can, playing your best game of defense against the blue ones. When all of
the Wizzrobes are dead, push the left block to the left and a staircase will
open in the upper right corner of the room. Take the staircase down to the
basement, kill the four Keese, and grab the Magic Wand from the platform on
the right. Time to give these Wizzrobes a taste of their own medicine. Oh
wait, the Magic Wand doesn't hurt them. Head back upstairs and return to B2.

-- B2 - Head across the strip of water and through the door to the right.

-- B3 - There are five Red Wizzrobes in here. First, use your Blue Candle to
brighten up the room. Kill the Wizzrobes as they teleport and then grab the
-=KEY=- that is in the middle of the room. Continue up through the door across
the water.

-- A3 - There are two Like Likes, two Zols, and two Bubbles in here. For some
reason, not even the Magic Wand can damage a Bubble. Take out the Like Likes
and the Zols and then bomb the right wall in here and continue through the
hole.

-- A4 - It's the Old Man again with another hint! He's chock full of em now.

              "T H E R E   A R E   S E C R E T S   W H E R E
                  F A I R I E S   D O N ' T   L I V E ."

Alrighty then. I think what he means is that there are secrets out in the
world except for where there are Fairy Ponds. In which case, no duh. Thanks a
lot Old Man. Now, backtrack through A3, B3, B2, and then down to C2.

-- C2 - Head down through the door to D2.

-- D2 - Wizzrobes are so shitty that the Vires in here are gonna feel like
relief. Light up the room with your Blue candle. Take out the Vires (and
appreciate how they don't split into Red Keese with the Magical Sword) and then
continue through the door to the right.

-- D3 - Yet another room chuck full of pain-in-the-ass enemies. These rooms are
far worse than any boss fight in this game. You've got two Red Wizzrobes, two
Blue Wizzrobes, three Like Likes, and a Bubble. Make sure you've got your Bow
equipped for this. Start with the Red Wizzrobes to get the random teleportation
attack out of the equation. Then hammer the Like Likes with arrows to take them
out without getting close. Finally, do a dance with the Blue Wizzrobes and get
them gone. Once everything in the room is dead, push the sole block in here to
the left and a staircase will appear in the top right corner. Head down to the
basement and go up the other side to arrive at coordinate B6.

-- B6 - There are two Zols and two Like Likes in here along with two Bubbles.
Take the Zols and the Like Likes out and then head down through the door.

-- C6 - Use the Blue Candle to brighten this room up. Kill the three Vires in
here and a -=KEY=- will appear. Grab the key and continue left through the
door.

-- C5 - Watch out for Traps as you enter this room! There's a couple of Blue
Wizzrobes in here, they shouldn't give you too much trouble since their numbers
are small. Ignore the door to the south, it leads to a dark room with a
restrictive path full of Wizzrobes who give you bombs when you kill them all.
So, it's useless. Instead, proceed up through the locked door to the boss
chamber.

Gohma is actually my favorite boss in this game. She's got the best name, she's
got a cool design, and she feels the most Zelda-y out of them all. Though I do
have to wonder why there's literally two bosses who are dragons and yet the
crab is the boss of the Dragon Labyrinth. Oh well.

Now I seriously 100% hope that you are really ready for a fight this time
cause... well, Gohma is pretty easy. Like, Dodongo easy. After going toe to toe
with Wizzrobes, she's gonna feel like a piece of cake. Let's get Krabs.

Poked her eye out like a Red Ryder BB Gun. Once she's dead, grab the -=HEART
CONTAINER=- she leaves behind and head through the door at the top. Grab the
-=TRIFORCE PIECE=- and you'll be teleported to the Labyrinth entrance. Dragon
Labyrinth complete!

Another Labyrinth, another Triforce Piece. Only two more left to get. So, let's
just head straight for the Demon Labyrinth, no time to waste. -=ALSO WE NEED TO
HAVE 100 RUPEES GOING INTO THE DEMON LABYRINTH=-. You also need to make sure
you have purchased the -=MONSTER BAIT=- from the Blue Ring shop, which you
should have already. And lastly, I'd pick up a Red Potion.

So, navigating to the Demon Labyrinth. It's a bit of a pain even though it's
three screens south from the Dragon Labyrinth. From the Dragon entrance: head
south down the stairs, then west into the graveyard. South one, west one, and
then south down the stairs. South one more time to enter the Lost Woods. Then
east one, north one, east one to get out of the lost part. If you chose to skip
the 100 rupees at the start of this guide, we can pause briefly here to grab
that now from this screen. Burn the -=TOPMOST=- bush in the single column that
bisects this screen and head down the stairs to grab the 100 rupees. Use the
map for help.

Now, head south one, east one, north two, and west one (either path, though top
is more convenient right now), then north one. You're here. To get here from
the origin point, you'll need to get back to the Lost Woods. So, from origin:
head north one and then west four to the start of the Lost Woods (G4). Don't
forget to grab a potion from the Old Lady on the way if you need to. Now head
north one, west one (either path, though top is more convenient right now),
then north one. You're here.

This square has a pond guarded by a Moblin and nothing else. WTF? Where's the
Labyrinth entrance? Have no fear. Equip your Recorder and play it. The pond
will dry up to reveal a flight of stairs: the entrance to the Demon Labyrinth.
Go on and head down.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- H2 - We've got two options here starting out: up or to the right. We're
going to head right first.

-- H3 - This room will have two Moldorms for you to take out. Make short work
of them and then the door at the top will open. Head up through that door.

-- G3 - Use the Blue Candle in here to light the place up. Kill the swarm of
Keese and then head through the door to the right.

-- G4 - There's quite a few Blue Goriyas in here for you to contend with. Kill
them all and the door on the top wall will open. Go ahead through to F4.

-- F4 - It's the Old Man again!

            "T H E R E ' S   A   S E C R E T   I N   T H E   T I P
                           O F   T H E   N O S E ."

Alright. Head back to G4 and then immediately right to G5.

-- G5 - There's a Digdogger aided by four Stone Statues in here. You can kill
it if you want easily enough using the Recorder, but you can just bypass it
and continue through the door on the right.

-- G6 - There's eight Stalfos in here rattling around. Show them how brittle
their bones are and kill them all. One of them will drop a -=KEY=-, so pick
that up and then head back left all the way to G3.

-- G3 - Use the Blue Candle in here again. Make your way around to the top wall
and use a bomb to open a passageway. Head through to F3.

-- F3 - You'll need to use the Blue Candle in here as well. Then kill all of
the Stalfos and one of them will drop the -=COMPASS=-. Pick it up and then head
left through the door.

-- F2 - There's a plethora more Goriyas in here to deal with (both Red and
Blue), so take them out and then head left once more.

-- F1 - Here we have a Dodongo room with three Dodongos waiting to have their
guts bombed. Bomb them all to clear the room (remember either they eat the bomb
or the smoke stuns them and you slash away). Once they're all dead, continue up
through the locked door.

-- E1 - It's the Old Man again, this time with another Bomb Upgrade. Give him
your hard-earned 100 rupees and you'll walk away with a 16-bomb capacity now.
Can't beat that. If you don't have 100 rupees (I told you to), you can fight
the Stalfos and Goriyas around the Labyrinth to get more. Once you've got the
Bomb Upgrade, head back to F1 and then down to G1.

-- G1 - Watch out for Traps as you enter! Kill all of the Keese in here and
they'll drop some bombs that you don't need. Continue down to H1.

-- H1 - There are two Stone Statues in here that will be constantly shooting
fireballs at you. Avoid or block the fireballs and grab the -=KEY=- in here
while dispatching the pesky Ropes. Once you have the key, backtrack all the way
up to G1, up to F1, right to F2, and then head up to E2.

-- E2 - There's going to be a two Goriyas, three Keese, and two Bubbles here
(I'll take this over Wizzrobes and Like Likes any day). Kill everything you can
kill in here and the door leading up will open. Head through it.

-- D2 - There's another Digdogger in here. It'll be easier if you kill this
one, but you can try to ignore it. All we need to do here is bomb the right
wall and head through to D3.

-- D3 - You'll find yourself in a desert room with two Moldorms to battle.
Dismantle them piece by piece and once they're dead, a -=KEY=- will appear.
Take the key and return to D2.

-- D2 - Shoot straight across left to D1.

-- D1 - The door will slam behind you and you'll be locked in with six Goriyas
(three Red and three Blue). Kill them all and a five-rupee piece will drop in
the corner. Grab it and then head up and use a key on the locked door.

-- C1 - This is a lot like an Old Man room except it's a Hungry Goriya. This
is the room we need the Monster Bait for, so I hope you picked it up. The
monster will hit you with "Grumble, grumble..." so swallow your fear and equip
your Monster Bait. Walk up to him and use the Monster Bait and he'll vanish
into thin air. Now you can proceed up to B1.

-- B1 - Use the Blue Candle to light this room up. Kill all of the Goriyas and
Keese in here while avoiding the Bubbles and then grab the map off the island.
Then make your way to the small platform at the top and bomb the top wall. Head
through.

-- A1 - Here's a nice little Rupee Room for you. Grab all the rupees in here
and then return to B1.

-- B1 - Once back in here, head right and use a key on the locked door. 

-- B2 - Kill all of the Goriyas in here, of which there are many, and then
continue up through the door.

-- A2 - There are more Goriyas in here (both Red and Blue this time). Kill them
all and a five-rupee piece will drop in the center. Grab your reward and
continue right through the next door.

-- A3 - There are four Stone Statues in the corners and Blue Goriyas
boomeranging about the room here. Kill the Goriyas and grab the -=KEY=- they
were guarding and then return promptly to through A2 to B2.

-- B2 - Instead of continuing to backtrack, bomb the right wall here to make a
passageway and head through.

-- B3 - There are a number of Goriyas in here and a blocked staircase. Kill all
of the Goriyas (use the magic wand or something with range to kill the ones
inside the blocks) and then push the leftmost block up to access the staircase.
Descend the stairs to the basement of this room. Kill the four Keese in here
and grab the Red Candle from the platform on the right to upgrade your candle
situation. Now you can use the candle as many times as you like in any room.
Return upstairs and bomb the right wall then continue through to B4.

-- B4 - There are six Blue Goriyas in here. Take them out and then continue
through the locked door to the right.

-- B5 - And lo, a third Digdogger room. This time we actually have to fight it.
So, whip out your Recorder and play a rocking tune and it will split into three
little Digdoggers. Stun them with your Boomerang and dice them up and the top
door will open. Head through it.

-- A5 - This room can kinda suck. There are two Stone Statues in the center of
the room and three Dodongos stomping about. Kill all of the Dodongos with bombs
and you'll also be rewarded with some bombs. Now bomb the right wall and head
through.

-- A6 - If the last room was difficult, this one is downright shitty. There are
a five  Wall Masters in this room and you'll actually have to kill them instead
of just avoiding them. And that can be tough. While you're trying to kill the
Wall Bastards, there are Bubbles floating about to make it even more annoying
for you. The good news, and there is good news, is that Wall Masters are one-
hit kills with your fancy-shmancy Magical Sword, so just don't get hit by a
Bubble when you're near a Wall Master and you should be alright. If you're
quick enough once you enter the room, you can spawn kill them all. Just head
directly to the top of the room towards the middle and they'll all spawn one-
by-one from the top wall. Kill them quickly before a Bubble comes up to ruin
your day. Once you've killed all five Wall Masters, you can push one of the
blocks in here. Use the diagram below to help you out.

                 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
                |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|     KEY:
                                  |_|       
                                  |P|>    P - Push Block
                                  |¯|     > - Direction
                |¯|¯|¯|¯|¯|¯|¯|¯|¯|¯|
                 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯

Push the block and stairs will appear in the top right corner of the room. Make
your way around to the stairs (saying a prayer of thanks that Bubbles don't
take health away) and head down to the basement. Kill the four Keese in here
and head up the other set of stairs to appear in C2.

-- C2 - You'll be in a room full of Goriyas (both Red and Blue). Take them all
out to give yourself some peace and quiet and when you're ready, bomb the right
wall. Head through to the boss chamber.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We get to fight Aquamentus again. Guess they ran out of steam with the bosses
and said eff it. Now Aquamentus is embarrassed and has something to prove, so I
hope that you're ready for a fight cause... well, Aquamentus is pretty easy
again. Let's hit replay on his ass.

  |  - Shoots a burst of three fireballs at you. Each fireball does a       |
  |    half heart of damage with the Blue Ring equipped                     |
  |  - That's it.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Strategy:                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you have full heart containers going into the fight, just sit in  |
  |    the back and shoot sword beams at him. He'll die after a few hits.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - The other strategy is to wait for him to fire a volley of fireballs, |
  |    dodge the projectiles, and then run up close and slash him. In my    |
  |    opinion, this is quicker and easier than shooting sword beams.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Beyond shooting fireballs, he barely even moves. He's a very         |
  |    stationary boss, so use that to your advantage when going in for     |
  |    the kill.                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Now that you have the Bow and Arrow, you can have some fun and kill  |
  |    him in three shots to the head.                                      |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Aquamentus is a very easy boss (even the second time). Shoot him with  |
  |  sword beams or wait for fireball volley and run up to slash him. You   |
  |  should be able to kill him without much fuss and get on to other       |
  |  things.                                                                |

Once Aquamentus has fallen, grab the -=HEART CONTAINER=- he leaves behind and
head through the door to the right. Grab the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- here and
teleport to the entrance. Demon Labyrinth complete!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, we've only got one Labyrinth left here: The Lion. We have nothing that we
need to do before heading that way so let's get to it. Head south one screen,
east two screens, and then south one screen and you'll be back at the Potion
Shop (G5). Be extra careful to keep all your hearts as you're going. While
we're here at G5, buy a Red Potion if you don't already have one.

Continue east one screen, north one screen, and then east eight screens (stick
to the top paths whenever there's a split), and south one screen (either path)
to G14. If you're navigating from the origin (H8): head east four screens
(H12) to the first area with water (where we got the first Heart Container),
north two screens, east along the top path then east again, and south one.

In this area (G14), you'll notice the screen is split into two sections by a
single wayward bush that's blocking the path through. Burn that bush with your
Red Candle to reveal a staircase: the entrance to the Lion Labyrinth. Descend
to your final trial before Death Mountain.

-- H4 - At the entrance, we have three doorways to choose from. Head to the
right first.

-- H5 - Kill the Zols and the Keese in here and grab the -=KEY=- from the
island. Head back through H4 and continue left to H3.

-- H3 - There are two Stone Statues in the center of the room that will be
shooting fireballs at you while a Manhandla bounces around shooting more
fireballs at you. You have to kill the Manhandla to get the left door to open,
which we need open, so do your best to kill it quickly without losing too much
health. Once it's dead and the doors open, grab the five-rupee reward and head
through the left door.

-- H2 - There will be three Gibdos, two Red Darknuts, one Blue Darknut, and two
Bubbles in here. Avoid the Bubbles while killing everything else. I start with
the Gibdos and work from there because they might drop a Stopwatch which is
helpful with the Darknuts. If you still have full health (doubtful) you can use
sword lasers. Once everything is dead, push the leftmost block up to access the
stairs and head down to the basement. Kill the four Keese down here and grab
the Magic Book from the platform on the right. Return upstairs and go backtrack
to the entrance (H4).

-- H4 - Now that we have the Magic Book, our Magic Wand is even more powerful
(and thusly even more useful). Now then, continue up through the door to G4.

-- G4 - We're going to have to face another Manhandla. Kill it to get it out of
your way and then bomb the top wall and head through to F4.

-- F4 - Here we have five Darknuts and a Stone Statue in each corner. Talk
about some of our least favorite things. Ignore them for now (though we will
have to deal with them momentarily so brace yourself for that) and head through
the locked door on the right.

-- F5 - Use the Red Candle to give yourself some light here. There's a large
group of Pols Voices bouncing about so deal with them (arrows all the way) and
then grab the -=COMPASS=- from the middle of the room. Head back left to F4.

-- F4 - Momentarily has arrived and we now have to kill all the Darknuts in
here. Godspeed and do the best you can to not lose too much health to them.
Laugh at your own pain as the last one left seems to predict your every move
and take more hearts than the other four and the Statues combined. Once
they're all dead, the top and left doors will open, and they will drop a
-=KEY=-. Grab the key and head left.

-- F3 - Illuminate this room with the Red Candle as you enter. There will be
two Pols Voices, two Gibdos, and two Keese in here. Dispatch them however you
feel like and grab the -=KEY=- that drops when they're dead. Continue left to
the next room.

-- F2 - There are another four Stone Statues in here (seriously, these things
are annoying as hell) and three Red Darknuts. Avoid the fireballs and kill the
Darknuts while giving thanks that they aren't Blue ones. When they're dead a
-=KEY=- will drop. Pick it up and head back through F3 and up to E3.

-- E3 - In here is a Blue Gohma. It's just a little bit stronger than the Gohma
we took care of earlier. Why this miniboss version is stronger than the boss
version from two Labyrinths ago is well beyond me, but whatever. It takes three
arrows to put it down, so poke it in the eye and the door at the top will open
once it dies so continue up.

-- D3 - It's an Old Man room again and he's got a doozy for you.

          "S P E C T A C L E   R O C K   I S   A N   E N T R A N C E
                             T O   D E A T H ."

He's telling us how to get to Death Mountain with this one. So, take that
information and head back down to E3.

-- E3 - Now we're going to head right and use a key on the locked door.

-- E4 - There are three Gibdos, two Red Darknuts, one Blue Darknut, and two
Bubbles in here. Evade the annoying Bubble bastards and kill the rest, starting
with the Gibdos. Once everything's dead, you'll get a five-rupee reward. Grab
the money and run up through the locked door to D4.

-- D4 - Enjoy another room full of Blue Darknuts with two Stone Statues in the
center. Kill all the Darknuts as quickly (and painlessly) as you can and the
door to the right will open. Ignore it for now and bomb the top wall then go
through.

-- C4 - There is another Manhandla in here. Kill it using the usual method and
it will drop the -=MAP=- for us. I used my Potion for the first time after
this fight, so you have a metric. Grab the map and head through the locked door
above.

-- B4 - Now you'll face a Blue Gohma with four Stone Statues in the corner.
Enjoy attempting to discern which fireballs can be blocked by your shield and
which cannot. Kill the Gohma as quickly as you can and continue through the
door on the right.

-- B5 - In this room there are two Red Darknuts, two Blue Darknuts, and two
Pols Voices. Kill everything however you want to and then push the leftmost
block up to access the stairs. Head down to the basement and kill the four
Keese before grabbing the -=MAGIC KEY=- off the platform to the right. This
will change your key counter to "A", which stands for "All" I think, meaning
you can now open every locked door without needing to find more keys. Which is
nice, considering there's not that many more locked doors we'll need to be
opening now. Head back upstairs and back to B4.

-- B4 - The door above leads to a room full of enemies without a decent reward
so there's no point in heading up there. Just head back down through C4 to D4.

-- D4 - You'll have to kill the Blue Darknuts in here again (starting to see
why I said to have a Red Potion handy?). Kill them all as best you can and then
head to the right once the doors open.

-- D5 - There are two Red Darknuts, a Blue Darknut, two Gibdos, and two Bubbles
in here. You can ignore everything in here and beeline the stairs if you like.
In the basement, head up the other flight of stairs to F2.

-- F2 - There's a ton of Pols Voices in here. Kill them in a fit of roid rage
(use your bow) and ignore the -=KEY=- in the corner since we have the Magic Key
now (or grab it if you're slightly neurotic like me). Ignore the door on
the left and bomb the top wall. The next room is the boss chamber so use some
Potion if you're hurting and head through.

Time for us to rematch the Gleeok, except this time he's got four heads. This
is the time when you should actually be ready for a fight cause... well, Gleeok
is still easy. More heads equals more deads.

  |  - In this specific case we're dealing with a four-head Gleeok. The     |
  |    four heads will shoot fireballs at you.                              |
  |  - Once you separate a head, the head will turn red and fly around the  |

  |  - Make sure you've got a decent bit of health going into the fight.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you have full health, use your sword beams from range to do the   |
  |    bulk of the work.                                                    |

  |  - If you don't, you'll have to get in close and just trade blows with  |
  |    him. Be consistent with your attacks and Gleeok will die before you  |
  |    do.                                                                  |

  |  - Now that we have the Magical Sword, it's two hits per head to        |
  |    decapitate.                                                          |

  |  Gleeok is basically just a multi-headed, more annoying version of      |
  |  Aquamentus. Use your sword beams from range if you have full health,   |
  |  otherwise get in close and trade blows with it. You should be coming   |
  |  out the other side in no time.                                         |

Just goes to show that one brain is better than four. Once it's dead, grab the
-=HEART CONTAINER=- from the corner and head through the door at the top. Grab
the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- here and you'll be teleported to the Labyrinth entrance.
Lion Labyrinth complete!

Well, well, well. So, you completed all of the Labyrinths. Good job. But our
quest isn't over just yet. Now that we've forged the Triforce piece from it's
fragments, we're ready to take down Ganon. But we need to make sure we're
ready.

  -- Make sure to replenish your Red Potion.
  -- Make sure you have a full stack of 16 Bombs.
  -- Make sure you have at least 100 rupees for Arrows.

Once you meet all that criteria, you're ready to head to Death Mountain. Go
ahead and return to the origin point (H8) from the Lion Labyrinth entrance
since it's right next door. And from the origin: go east one, north five, west
one, and north one to enter the Death Mountain area. Now, cross the river and
head up the staircase. Go west two to a screen with two rocks. These are the
"Spectacle Rocks", cause the screen looks like a pair of glasses (a.k.a.
spectacles). Bomb the left rock at the -=BOTTOM MIDDLE=- to make a door. Use
the map for help.

Okay. The Big Kahuna. We got this. As you can see from the map, this is a much
more complicated Labyrinth that the others, so we're going to go piece by piece
and I'll break the map down for you as we move along.


                          6     7
                        ===== =====           KEY:

                        ===== =====           E - Entrance

                              =====           K - Key
                    H        |  E  |          O - Old Man
                              =====

-- H7 - Here we are, starting out. Only one direction to go so head up to G7.

-- G7 - Normally there'd be an Old Man here that tells you you're doomed and
should turn back. But since we've beaten all eight Labyrinths, he's not here.
Ignore the door to your left and continue straight ahead.

-- F7 - There are two Zols, two Like Likes, and two Bubbles in here. Avoid
them since all they drop for you is a key (and we have a Magic Key) and bomb
the left wall. Head through the opening.

-- F6 - In this room, we'll encounter Lanmolas for the first time. They're
basically Moldorms with an extra caveat. You can't damage their head (the one
section that looks different) until you've cut away the rest of their body.
Still, about as difficult as a Moldorm, which is not at all, and the Magical
Wand works wonders for them. So, kill them and push the leftmost block in here
up to access the stairs. Head down the stairs to the basement and kill the
four Keese down here then head up the other stairs to B5.

                      =====

-- B5 - There's a whole lot of Like Likes in this room and your area is greatly
restricted, which fortunately hinders the Like Likes as much as it does you.
Kill the Like Likes quickly and don't let them get your shield! Head right
through the locked door.

-- B6 - Use the Red Candle in here to light the place up. There's three Blue
Wizzrobes starved for attention so leave them hungry and mad dash to the bottom
of the room. Bomb the bottom wall as quick as you can and move through.

-- C6 - There's two Like Likes, two Zols, and two Bubbles in here, and you'll
notice immediately the room is divided in three and you're in the middle path.
If there's any enemies in the path with you, kill them and then bomb the bottom
wall and head through.

-- D6 - There's three Blue Wizzrobes and a Red Wizzrobe in here. Kill them all
and the last one will drop the -=COMPASS=- for you. Grab and make your way back
to B6.

-- B6 - Keep ignoring the Blue Wizzrobes in here and hurry through the door to
the right now.

-- B7 - This room also has a new enemy in it. A Patra, which is a blue flying
thing surrounded by smaller flying things. But we can ignore it for a moment
and hurry out through the bottom door.

-- C7 - Ah, the sweet simplicity of Gels. Kill them off if you want and bomb
the wall on the right. Head through the new hole.

-- C8 - Another Patra here and this time we have to fight it. The way to kill
a Patra is by first killing all of the little flying things that spin around

it. You cannot damage the actual Patra until the little buggers around it have
all been destroyed. And they take two hits head to get rid of. Once they're
all gone, it takes three hits to destroy the central guy. Once you've killed
this Patra (and hopefully not lost too many hearts, the -=MAP=- will drop for
you. Grab it and then bomb the north wall in here and continue through the
hole.

-- B8 - There's two Blue Wizzrobes, two Red Wizzrobes, three Like Likes, and a
Bubble in here. If that sentence didn't make you roll your eyes, nothing will.
The good news is that you can largely ignore them as you bomb the north wall
and head through, just watch your back with the Like Likes.

-- A8 - There's a plethora of Blue and Red Wizzrobes in here. Kill them all
while trying not to lose hearts. Once they're all dead, push the leftmost block
up to access the stairs and head down to the basement. Kill the four Keese down
here and grab the -=RED RING=- from the platform on the right. This will reduce
our incoming damage by another factor of 2 (factor of 4 total from base
incoming damage). Head back upstairs and backtrack to B7.

-- B7 - Now it's time to kill the Patra, though it's much less of a threat to
our health now that we have the Red Ring. Take it down like you did the last
one and then head up through the locked door.

-- A7 - The Old Man is in here and he's got a cryptic message for us.

                 "G O   T O   T H E   N E X T   R O O M ."

But there's no other doors... Could it be? Yes, it could. Bomb the wall to the
left and continue through the hole.

-- A6 - There two Red Wizzrobes and three Blue Wizzrobes in here. Kill them all
and then turn your attention to the two blocks in here. You should know what to
do by now. Push the left block left to reveal a staircase in the top right
corner. Head down it to the basement and kill the four Keese. Then head up the
other staircase to G4.

                                          K - Key

-- G4 - There's six Zols in here. Kill them all and grab whatever they drop
before heading through the locked door to the left.

-- G3 - There's a swarm of Keese in here. Kill them all if you want five
rupees, otherwise continue through the door to the left.

-- G2 - Admire the Patra's new moves briefly and then kill it unceremoniously.
Once it's dead, push the leftmost block up to access the staircase. Head down
to the basement and kill the four Keese down here. Head up the other staircase
to C1.

-- C1 - There's three Blue Wizzrobes and two Red Wizzrobes in here. Kill them
all to get them out of your way and then bomb the top wall. Head through to B1.

-- B1 - There's three Blue Wizzrobes, two Red Wizzrobes, and three Bubbles in
here. Do your best with the bubbles while you kill the Wizzrobes. Once
everything is dead, use the diagram below to determine which block to push.

Once you push the block, a staircase will appear in the top right corner. Make
your way around the blocks to the stairs and head down to the basement. Kill
the four Keese and grab the Silver Arrow from the platform on the right. Head
back upstairs and back down to C1.

-- C1 - Push the leftmost block up to access the stairs and head down to the
basement. You'll have to kill the Keese again then head up the other stairs
back to G2.

-- G2 - Once you're back in G2, head up to F2.

-- F2 - There are six Like Likes in here. Use the Magic Wand to kill them from
range (or sword beams if you have full health) and once they're all dead, the
door to the left will open. Continue to the left.

-- F1 - You'll be in a dark room with five Zols. If you kill one with your
upgraded Magic Wand, the fire will light the room up and you won't have to
switch to the Red Candle. Kill the rest and then head up through the locked
door.

-- E1 - There will be two Blue Wizzrobes and two Red Wizzrobes in here and
you'll be pretty limited in your movement options. You can skip them or kill
them, doesn't matter, just continue up through the next locked door.

-- D1 - Watch out for the Traps as you enter! There's two Blue Wizzrobes and a
Red Wizzrobe in here. Kill them quickly. Then push the left block to the left
and some stairs will appear in the right corner under the trap. Bait it into
moving and then head down the stairs to the basement. Kill the Keese down here
and then head up the other stairs to A5.

-- A5 - There's two Red Wizzrobes and two Blue Wizzrobes in here and Traps in
the corner. Do your best to kill the Wizzrobes without taking too much damage
and then bomb the wall on the left. Head through to A4.

-- A4 - There are two Zols, two Like Likes, and two Bubbles in here. Dodge the
bubbles as you take out the rest, after all you're a pro now. Once everything's
dead, push the leftmost block up and head down the stairs to the basement. Kill
the four Keese and head up the other stairs to F3.

-- F3 - There is another Patra in here. Kill it and the door at the top will
open, which leads to Ganon's room. Drink a potion if you have one and equip
your Bow with the Silver Arrows now. When you're ready, head through the door.

And just like that we're at the last boss. Feels like just this morning we
started this whole adventure, probably cause it was very likely actually this
morning. But alright, I know we've messed around before, but this time I really
for real hope that you're ready for a battle cause... well, Ganon is also easy.

Now then, the Second Quest. It's honestly quite a bit more difficult than the
First Quest, but it's still an enjoyable experience and not too much trouble if
you keep your wits about you and do it in the proper order (which conveniently,
I'm about to help you do).

The dungeons are different, the bosses are different, the items are jumbled up,
and the difficulty is upped a bit. An interesting added mechanic the we'll
encounter are "illusion walls" that will sometimes work both ways or only work
one way.

Additionally, if you follow this guide exactly, you'll have more than enough
keys (just like in First Quest). If you choose to explore, try not to use a lot
of keys. NEVER BUY KEYS.

And lastly, there are three new enemies that we will encounter: Red Bubbles
(disables your sword PERMANENTLY), Blue Bubbles (gives your sword back), and
Electric Ropes (just like regular ropes but electrified).

Once again, the strategy I present below is, in my opinion, the best strategy
to beat The Legend of Zelda, Second Quest. Follow it faithfully or use it when
you need it, entirely up to you. Let's get this show on the road.

You'll notice quickly that things are quite different this time around. Most of
the Overworld has stayed the same (though the locations of most things have
changed), while you'll see soon that the Labyrinths have been completely
redone.

Welcome to Second Quest! It's harder (and more fun I think) and I'll be your
tour guide this evening. So, let's kick things off by heading to the cave at
our origin coordinate (H8).

            "I T ' S   D A N G E R O U S   T O   G O   A L O N E!
                            T A K E    T H I S."

The Old Man will give you a -=WOODEN SWORD=-. If you thought it was bad the
first time around, wait until you actually have to use it through a Labyrinth.
But before we can get to that, there's some things we need to do.

The first item on our shopping list is the Blue Candle once again. So, we need
to get 60 rupees to afford our bush burner once again. So, we're going to kill
some enemies until we have bombs and hit some hidden places. Make your way hard
east all the way to H16, killing everything along the way. Something should
drop bombs for you. If they don't, head up to G16 and buy some bombs from the
Shop there since you should at least have 20 rupees. Now, we're just going to
follow the coast north three (from G16), west one, north one, west one. And
we're at C14. Bomb the north-most wall on the -=MIDDLE TILE=-. Use the map for
help.

Grab the 30 rupees from inside and then immediately head south one screen to
D14. Move the Armos on the right to reveal a staircase. Head down and grab the
30 Rupees from inside. Now that we have 60 rupees, we can return to the origin
and head to G7 (north one, west one) and buy the Blue Candle.

That wasn't too bad. Well, it's about to be. We now need to get 250 rupees to
pick up the Blue Ring. It's more necessary now that it was before, so we have
no choice. Since we have the Blue Candle we can go ahead and pick up the ONLY
100-rupee gift on the map in Second Quest. For that, we need to make our way to
F4.

So, head east three screens (past the Potion Shop) to G4 and the Lost Woods,
then head north one to F4. Use the Blue Candle to burn the -=BOTTOM LEFT=-
green bush here. Use the map for help.

Head down the revealed stairs and grab the 100 rupees. After we grab that
though, there's not much else we can grab. So, we have to farm rupees. We have
two options for doing that.

1. Run our farming loop from H9 to H16 to H12 to G12 to G9 and then back
around. This is a great way to get a bunch of rupees, especially if you can
continue to get a bunch of kills without taking damage as every 10th kill will
drop a five-rupee piece guaranteed.

2. Use the second controller to save the game and play the Gambling Game at
H7 over and over until we have 255 rupees. Probably the faster of the two
options but does involve continuously saving and retrying if luck doesn't go
your way.

However you want to do it, farm rupees until you're maxed out at 255 and then
we need to make our way to A16 (where we got a 100-rupee gift in First Quest).
So, from origin: head east one, north five, east five, north one, east two to
B16. If you got the 100-rupee gift, you should recognize this area. There's
a secret path on the north wall just to the right of the cave. Use the map for
help.

Take the secret path up to A16 and enter the cave here. Inside is the fourth
Shop with the -=BLUE RING=-! Buy the Blue Ring and listen to the game laugh at
you as all your rupees ding away. But don't worry, you got the good end of
the deal.

Now that we have the Blue Ring, we should get the one Heart Container that we
can actually find right now. To do that, we need to get to Hyrule Graveyard,
specifically coordinate C1. So, from A16: head back down the steps, then west
two, south one, west five, south four, west five (into the Lost Woods), south
one, west two (along bottom path), and then north one in to G2, the actual Lost
Woods screen.

Remember the code here: ULDL (up, left, down, left) and head those directions
to go west one more to G1. Head north four from here to the top left screen of
the Graveyard. The tombstone we need to move is -=SECOND COLUMN, MIDDLE ROW=-.
Use the map for help.

Push the Tombstone up and head down the stairs to find the Old Man. He will
give you the choice between a Red Potion or a -=HEART CONTAINER=-. Didn't we go
through this in the First Quest? Pick the Heart Container. Jeez. That will
bring us up to a whopping four hearts. Whoopty doo, Basil.

And now, for our last errand, we need to get the Power Bracelet. This is more
of a while we're in the area errand and less of a necessity. So, let's head
south one, east three, north one (right staircase), and east one. Move the
top right Armos here to reveal the -=POWER BRACELET=-. Use the map for help.

And that's all we have to do for now. It's time to make our way to the first
Labyrinth. Fortunately, this one is in the same location as First Quest.
Unfortunately, it's a bit of a pain in the ass to get to from here. We
basically have to get all the way back around to the origin and head up from
there (there is LITERALLY no other way). So, head back to the origin (H8).

From the origin, head: east one, north four, and west one across the bridge.
Enter the cave here to start the E Labyrinth.

-- H1 - From the entrance, we have two options: up or right. We're going to
head right first.

-- H2 - Kill the five Red Goriyas in here and the -=BOOMERANG=- will appear for
you. Take it, then return to the entrance and head up now.

-- G1 - Kill the three Red Goriyas in here while dodging fireballs from the two
Stone Statues in the middle. When the Goriyas are dead, take the -=KEY=- they
drop. Bomb the right wall (remember, we always bomb the middle of the wall in
Labyrinths) but don't go through just yet. Instead, head up.

-- E1 - Kill the Stalfos in here (careful, they now throw their swords as well)
and they'll drop the -=COMPASS=-. Grab it and continue up to D1.

-- D1 - Killing the three Blue Goriyas in here will drop bombs for you. Feel
free to skip and continue up to C1.

-- C1 - Killing all of the Gels in here will drop five rupees for you. Feel
free to skip and head right through the locked door.

-- C2 - MINIBOSS - Dodongo. You know how to kill it. Bomb its guts out and the
sealed door at the bottom will open. Continue through to D2.

-- D2 - Watch out for Traps as you enter! Kill the four Keese in here to open
the door from where you came. Then grab the map from in here and backtrack all
the way to G1 where you bombed the wall.

-- G1 - Head through the bomb opening now.

-- G2 - Kill the five Keese in here and then push the leftmost stone to access
the stairs in here. Head down and kill the four Keese then continue up the
other side.

-- B2 - You'll face three Bubbles and some Wall Masters. Kill all of the Wall
Masters and they will drop a -=KEY=- (if you can find an area where they spawn
from the wall, you can stand beside it and spawn kill them, just watch out for
the Bubbles). Take the Key and continue left.

-- B1 - It's not necessary to kill the three Blue Goriyas in here. Just avoid
the fireballs from the Stone Statues and bomb the top wall, then head through
the hole to face the first Boss.

Well, that was quick. We're already facing the first boss and it should be a
familiar foe if you didn't skip straight to Second Quest. Aquamentus the fire-
breathing dragon. Now, I hope you're ready for a fight cause... well, he's more
of a nuisance than anything. With the Wooden Sword, he's just kind of annoying,
but I wouldn't say hard. So, let's fire him.

  |                                                                         |

  |  - Shoots a burst of three fireballs at you. Each fireball does a       |
  |    half heart of damage with the Blue Ring equipped                     |
  |  - That's it.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Strategy:                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you have full heart containers going into the fight, just sit in  |
  |    the back and shoot sword beams at him. He'll die after a few hits.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - The other strategy is to wait for him to fire a volley of fireballs, |
  |    dodge the projectiles, and then run up close and slash him. In my    |
  |    opinion, this is quicker and easier than shooting sword beams.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - With the Wooden Sword, he will take six hits to put down.            |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Beyond shooting fireballs, he barely even moves. He's a very         |
  |    stationary boss, so use that to your advantage when going in for     |
  |    the kill.                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Aquamentus is a very easy boss (not surprising considering he's the    |
  |  first boss of the game. Shoot him with sword beams or wait for         |
  |  fireball volley and run up to slash him. You should be able to kill    |
  |  him without much fuss and get on to other things.                      |
   \_______________________________________________________________________/

Once he's fallen, grab your -=HEART CONTAINER=- reward and continue through the
door to the right. Pick up the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- and you'll be warped out of
the dungeon.

Not so bad, right? And now that we have five hearts, we can go ahead and
upgrade to the White Sword and ditch this Wooden turd. From the entrance to the
E Labyrinth, head: east one, north one, west one, north one (watch out for
Rocks now), east four, and then north up the stairs. Enter the cave here and
you'll find the Old Man once again.

           "M A S T E R   U S I N G   I T   A N D   Y O U   C A N
                            H A V E   T H I S."

And master we have, so take the -=WHITE SWORD=- and rejoice, for you're no
longer a scrub and I don't want no scrubs. Once you have the White Sword, we
should go ahead and pick up the Magical Shield so we can block all these damn
fireballs. So, return to the Overworld and head south one, west four, south
one, east one, south two (if you need rupees, there's a 30-rupee gift here (E9)
if you burn the topmost bush you can in the three columns on the right. Use
the map section if you can't find it.), and west two. We're going to burn the
-=CORNER BUSH=- here for Shop 3 (same as in First Quest). Use the map for help.

Head into the shop and buy the -=MAGICAL SHIELD=- for 90 rupees. Now return to
the Overworld and we're ready to head to the A Labyrinth, which is conveniently
nearby. Head south one, west one, south one, west one, north three and we're
here: D5, where the Blue Ring was in First Quest. Now, move the -=TOP MIDDLE=-
Armos to reveal the stairs down. Use the map for help.

Boss numero dos. And it's not Dodongo, so already things are changing order.
We're actually facing a three-headed Gleeok this time, so I hope you're ready
for a fight now cause... well, he's a chump. Let's head on in.

  |  "A huge dragon that has 2 to 4 heads and      | Received:              |
  |  spits out beams at Link. Heads that Link cuts |  -- Heart Container    |
  |  off from its body fly around in the air.      |  -- Triforce Piece 3   |

  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Attacks:                                                               |
  |  - In this specific case we're dealing with a two-head Gleeok. The two  |
  |    heads will shoot fireballs at you.                                   |
  |  - Once you separate a head, the head will turn red and fly around the  |
  |    room shooting fireballs at you.                                      |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Strategy:                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Make sure you've got a decent bit of health going into the fight.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you have full health, use your sword beams from range to do the   |
  |    bulk of the work.                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you don't, you'll have to get in close and just trade blows with  |
  |    him. Be consistent with your attacks and Gleeok will die before you  |
  |    do.                                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - I know that's not much of a strategy but don't blame me, blame the   |
  |    game designers.                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Gleeok is basically just a multi-headed, more annoying version of      |
  |  Aquamentus. Use your sword beams from range if you have full health,   |
  |  otherwise get in close and trade blows with it. You should be coming   |
  |  out the other side in no time.                                         |
   \_______________________________________________________________________/

As always with Gleeok, it's a battle of attrition. So, once he's been worn out,
grab the -=HEART CONTAINER=- and continue up through the next door. Grab the
-=TRIFORCE PIECE=- and you'll be warped to the Overworld again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   L A Y I N G   D O W N   F L U T E   T R A C K S                   [203-3]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we have the Recorder, there's a few things we can get around the
Overworld, namely a couple of Heart Containers. From the entrance to the A
Labyrinth, head south three, east four, north four, east two, and south one to
reach D11. Play the Recorder here and some stairs will magically appear. Head
down and the Old Man will give you the choice between Red Potion and a -=HEART
CONTAINER=-. Will you ever-- JUST GRAB THE HEART CONTAINER.

Now then, we gotta go around our ass to get to our elbow. We're gonna head
back towards the origin by going south one, west one, south two, west two. For
reference, we are at G8, one above the origin. Continue west four, south one,
west two (bottom path), north one, ULDL (up, left, down, left), north three,
east three, north (right stairs), east two, north one (either stairs), east
two, north one up the stairs, and finally west one. Holy balls, was that a
trek.

We're at A7 now, so kill the Lynels (and Peahats if you're patient enough) then
play your Recorder again and another flight of stairs will appear. Head down
and the Old Man will give you the choice of-- Oh, forget it. Every time with
this! You want the Potion? Get the Potion. IF YOU'RE AN IDIOT! Take the -=HEART
CONTAINER=- like a smart person and head back up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's one more thing we can go ahead and do while we're over here now that
our gear doesn't suck and we have more than three hearts. There will be a lot
of Lynels on this little trek so brace yourself for that. Head east one, south
down the stairs, west five, north up the stairs, west two, south down the
stairs and we're here: B2. Push the leftmost rock either direction to reveal a
staircase. Use the map for help.

Head down the stairs and you'll receive the -=LETTER=- from the Old Man. Now,
we can unlock the Potion Shop. So, let's drop this off really quick. Make sure
you're Recorder is still equipped, face north (or east) and play it. Since
there're no secrets on this screen, it will warp you to the entrance of the E
Labyrinth (if it does not, face north or east and play the Recorder again).
This is Recorder Warping. It will take you to each Labyrinth that you have
completed in Level order. Face north/east to warp forward through the list and
face south/west to warp backward through the list. One important note is that
it will warp you to the locations of the Labyrinths in First Quest, even though
we're in Second Quest (i.e. it will warp you to H5 for A Labyrinth instead of
D5). As far as I have tested, here is where it takes you for each Labyrinth:

   -- E Labyrinth: D8 (same)
   -- A Labyrinth: H5
   -- L Labyrinth: D13 (same)
   -- D Labyrinth: A12 (fairy pond)
   -- Z Labyrinth: E6 (same)
   -- Wizard Hat Labyrinth: C3 (30 rupees here)
   -- Apostrophe Labyrinth: E3
   -- Spiral Labyrinth: G14

Additionally, it will skip any Labyrinths you haven't done. So, from here on
out, I will simply say "warp to such and such" and leave you to it.

Now, from E Labyrinth head east one, south three, and west four to G5. Head
into the cave here and give the Letter to the Old Woman. Now we have unlocked
Potion Shops. Buy a Red Potion and head back out to the Overworld.

Now we have just one more thing to do and that is: buy Monster Bait. For that
we need 60 rupees. So, make sure you have that and hit the Gambling Game if you
don't. To get Bait for that cheap, we have to go back to the Blue Ring shop,
so warp back to E Labyrinth and head east one, north one, east four, north one,
east two, and north one through the hidden stairs. Buy the -=MONSTER BAIT=- for
60 rupees and we're ready to hit the third Labyrinth.

Warp back to the E Labyrinth one more time and head east one, south two, east
five (keep to the top path at F12), north one, west one, and north one up the
stairs. There's a little pond here. The L Labyrinth is hidden just like the
Demon Labyrinth was in First Quest. Play the Recorder to drain the pond and
reveal the entrance then head inside.

-- F2 - Kill the six Red Goriyas in here and continue right through the locked
door to the boss. WOW!

That was quick (you'll see why momentarily). For now, our boss here is three
Dodongos. Now, I hope you're genuinely ready for a fight cause... who am I
kidding? It's Dodongos. Let's blow it.

  |  - Just like the description says, the Dodongo doesn't have much        |
  |    attacking power, in that it doesn't attack at all.                   |
  |  - He just walks around the room. But this time there's three of them.  |
  |                                                                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Strategy:                                                              |

  |  - The Dodongo is impervious to everything in your arsenal except bombs |
  |    but you probably guessed that cause the Labyrinth gave you bombs     |
  |    twice and you were smart enough to figure out the Old Man's clue.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - As the Dodongo walks around the room, lay a bomb in its path. As it  |
  |    walks over the bomb, it will eat it and then the bomb will explode   |
  |    inside it. Do this twice and the Dodongo will perish.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If for whatever reason the Dodongo doesn't eat your bomb, the smoke  |
  |    will still stun it and you can run up and slash him to bits during   |
  |    that window.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Dodongo is probably the easiest boss in this game. Drop bombs in his   |
  |  path twice or stun him with smoke and hack away with your sword. This  |
  |  is an easy win so dispatch them and I'll see you on the other side.    |

Well that was easy. So why was this so short? Because, we still have the rest
of the Labyrinth to hit and for some reason they put the boss right at the
front. Grab the -=HEART CONTAINER=- that's left behind for you and head back
out to F2.

-- F2 - Head up now through the other door.

-- E2 - There are six Electric Ropes in here (just normal Ropes but with a
little static charge). Kill them and they will drop bombs for you since you
probably need some after the Dodongo fight. Continue up.

-- D2 - Kill all of the five Blue Goriyas here to open the sealed door above
and then get the map if you didn't grab it already. Continue up.

-- C2 - Kill the six Stalfos in here and grab the -=KEY=- that drops once they
are dead. Continue up. Exciting stuff, right?

-- B2 - There's a Hungry Goriya here, so equip your Monster Bait and feed him
to make him disappear. Continue up through the locked door.

-- A2 - Kill the six Red Goriyas in here and grab the -=MAGIC BOOMERANG=-.
Yippee, or whatever. Head back down five to F2, then right through the Boss
Chamber (the Dodongos will be back but you can just breeze past them, no need
to fight them again) and continue down to F3.

-- F3 - Get the -=COMPASS=- from in here and kill all of the Wall Masters
(there's eight of them). Push the middle stone on the right side to open the
passage.

Head down the stairs kill the Keese down here, then continue up the other side.

-- C1 - Kill the six Red Goriyas here and grab the -=KEY=-. Continue up one.

-- B1 - Grab the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- here and you will be warped back to the
Overworld.

I agree, the order of that Labyrinth is bizarre. It's also a tad dull thanks
to its shape. But now that it's over, we can head to the D Labyrinth. From the
L Labyrinth, head south one, east one, north two, north again up the stairs,
and west two. We're now at B12, the screen that repeats itself. Instead of
heading north four times like we had to in First Quest, our Labyrinth entrance
is on this very screen. Push the far-right stone (up or down) to reveal stairs.
Use the map for help.

-- H2 - Three options here, we're going to go left first.

-- H1 - Use the Blue Candle to light the room. There's three Keese, two Zols,
and three Bubbles in here. Kill the Zols and the Keese and grab the -=KEY=-
that appears. Return to H2 and head up this time.

-- G2 - MINIBOSS - Digdogger. Play your Recorder here to shrink the Digdogger
and beat up the three mini Digdoggers to open the left door. Head through.

-- G1 - We've got two Red Darknuts, two Blue Darknuts, and two Pols Voices in
here. Kill them all (easier said than done) and the -=COMPASS=- will drop for
you. Grab it and head up.

-- F1 - Illuminate the room with the Blue Candle. Now we're going to encounter
some new enemy types in here: Red and Blue Bubbles. There's three Red Bubbles
and one Blue Bubble along with four Darknuts (two of each color). Avoid the Red
Bubbles like the plague (they will disable your sword PERMANENTLY or until you
touch a Blue Bubble). Kill the Darknuts to open the door above. Continue right
through the locked door (you can skip the enemies in here for now, but you'll
have to kill them sooner or later).

-- F2 - MINIBOSS - Aquamentus. Kill the Aquamentus in here by slashing it's
dome and then head through the door on the right.

-- F3 - You've got two Gibdos, two Keese, and two Pols Voices to contend with.
Kill everything and then push far left block in the middle row up to reveal a
staircase in the top right corner.

               ¯    ¯    ¯ ¯    ¯    ¯

Head down the stairs to the basement. Kill the four Keese and grab the -=MAGIC
BOOK=- from the platform on the right. Now we don't have the Magic Wand yet,
but when we do get it, it will immediately be ultra-powerful! Head back up the
stairs and go up through the illusion wall.

-- E3 - Here the Old Man will offer you a Bomb Upgrade. Pay him the 100 rupees
and you'll be able to carry 12 bombs now. Continue left through another
illusion wall.

-- E2 - Killing the five Red Darknuts in here will drop some bombs for you.
Since you just bought the Bomb Upgrade and don't need bombs, feel free to
ignore them entirely and continue left through the locked door.

-- E1 - We've got six Blue Darknuts to deal with. There are two Stone Statues
in the lower corners, but they don't show fireballs, so don't worry about it.
Kill the Blue Darknuts and a Key will drop. Continue up.

-- D1 - Watch out for Traps as you enter! Kill the two Zols in here and head
up again.

-- C1 - Use the Blue Candle to light the room and then kill the five Zols in
here. Grab the bombs that drop if you need and continue right.

-- C2 - Push the block in the middle to the right and continue down.

-- D2 - Two Gibdos, two Keese, and two Pols Voices in here. Kill them all and a
-=KEY=- will drop. Grab it, then bomb the right wall and continue through.

-- D3 - Grab the rupees in here and then head back through D2 and then back up
to C2.

-- C2 - Now push the block up and bomb the right wall. Continue through to C3.

-- C3 - MINIBOSS - Dodongo. Dodge the fireballs from the four Stone Statues
while you kill the Dodongo and then continue up through the next door.

-- B3 - You've got six Blue Darknuts and two Stone Statues in the center. Kill
the Blue Darknuts as quickly as you can and the -=MAP=- will appear.

Fun fact of trivia for you to ponder while you're suffering through prescient
Darknuts and a holy barrage of fireballs: Second Quest was initially planned as
a separate sequel to Legend of Zelda called "Zelda II: Hope You Like Darknuts",
but the title didn't test well with anyone other than masochists, so they made
it into Second Quest instead.

Grab the map you just worked your ass off for and head back down, then left,
then up to B2.

-- B2 - Kill all of the Keese in her and then marvel at the middle finger from
this game as the -=KEY=- appears across the water. Bomb the top wall and head
through.

-- A2 - And here we have our first Thief room. He'll give you the choice
between your life or your money. ALWAYS choose money. ALWAYS. The heart docks
you a FULL HEART CONTAINER PERMANENTLY!! Never choose that. Give the bastard
50 rupees and continue right.

-- A3 - Push the left block in the middle group and a staircase will open in
the top right corner. Head down, kill the four Keese, and continue up the other
stairs to G4.

-- G4 - WATCH OUT FOR RED BUBBLES AS YOU ENTER! Do NOT touch these Bubbles or
you have to backtrack to the one Blue Bubble. Immediately head up through the
locked door to the Boss.

Now we're gonna fight Digdogger. So, I hope that you've been preparing well for
a fight cause... Digdogger's easy. Far easier than room B3 was. So, let's give
the dog a bone.

  |  "Big sea urchins. In spite of their big       | Received:              |
  |  bodies, they shrivel up when attacked. But    |  -- Heart Container    |
  |  watch out! They come on pretty strong."       |  -- Triforce Piece 3   |

  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Attacks:                                                               |
  |  - Digdogger doesn't really have any attacks, it just constantly moves  |
  |    around the room. If it touches you, it will do damage.               |
  |  - Also watch out for the four statues in the corner that will be       |
  |    continuously shooting fire at you                                    |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Strategy:                                                              |

  |  - Digdogger's strategy makes him one of the easiest bosses in the      |
  |    game. Make sure you have your Recorder equipped and play it during   |
  |    the fight.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - The Recorder melody will cause Digdogger to shrivel up to three tiny |
  |    Digdoggers. Once he's been shrunk down, four slashes with the White  |
  |    Sword will take each one out.                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Digdogger moves pretty fast once it's been shrunk down. You can use  |
  |    the Boomerang to stun it and keep it in place while you whack at it. |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - You'll need to be evading the Stone Statue fireballs the entire      |
  |    time, cause they'll just keep peppering you. They're honestly a      |
  |    bigger threat than Digdogger.                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Digdogger is a giant floating booger and a scaredy-cat. Play your      |
  |  Recorder to shrink it down and then hit it with a Boomerang and hack   |
  |  it to bits. A quick jam session and you'll be outta there in no time.  |

Once you've slice and diced Digdogger, grab the -=HEART CONTAINER=- it drops
and head up to the next room, but DON'T GRAB THE TRIFORCE.

Head up through an illusion wall.

-- D4 - Kill the three Red Darknuts in here while avoiding the Stone Statues'
fireballs and the door above will open. Head up.

-- C4 - MINIBOSS - Dodongos. Kill the three Dodongos while avoiding more
fireballs from Stone Statues and the doors will open. Continue up.

-- B4 - There's two Red Darknuts, two Blue Darknuts, and two Pols Voices in
here. Kill them all and then push the fourth block down in the left most column
to the left to reveal a staircase in the top right corner.

                    ¯

Head down and kill the four Keese then grab the -=RAFT=- from the platform on
the right. Go back upstairs and head down three to the Triforce room.

-- E4 - Now you may grab the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- and you will be warped to the
Overworld.

Great, that Labyrinth's over with (and good riddance honestly, that one sucks).
Now we got some rafting around to do. So, from the D Labyrinth entrance, head
west four, south one, east seven, down one, and east one to D16. Step off the
dock to raft north C16. Enter the cave here and the Old Man will give you the
choice between Red Potion or a -=HEART CONTAINER=-. Seriously? We're gonna do
this every time? Just take the damn Heart Container.

Now we can head to the Z Labyrinth. Go back outside and warp to the E Labyrinth
again. Now head east one, south two, and west four to F6. Rafting up from the
dock here will take us to the Z Labyrinth, but there's something we can do to
be more prepared. Head south one then west one and buy a Potion if you need,
then continue north two and head into the cave here. Buy Arrows for 80 rupees
and then return to F6 and raft north. Enter the Z Labyrinth.

-- H2 - Don't bother with the four Wizzrobes in here, just avoid the three
Red Bubbles and head left through the illusion wall.

-- H1 - Light the room with the Blue Candle and kill all the Keese for a

-- B3 - Evade the Red Bubbles and head down the stairs on the right. Kill the
four Keese down here and collect the -=BOW=- from the platform. Hey, that's
exactly what we need to kill the Gohma. Equip your bow and head back to A3.

-- A3 - MINIBOSS - Blue Gohma. Poke Gohma in the eye a bit and once she's dead,
a -=KEY=- will drop. Grab the Key and head back left, then back down the
stairs.

-- H2 - Immediately beeline back up through the door, ignoring the Wizzrobes
and avoiding the Red Bubbles.

-- G2 - Equip your Blue Candle and head left then up to F1.

-- F1 - Light the room with the Blue Candle. Skip these Wizzrobes, just avoid
the Red Bubbles and go up.

-- E1 - Haul ass to avoid the  cheap shot from the Trap in here and hurry
through the door on the right.

-- E2 - Kill the Zols in here and the -=COMPASS=- will appear. Grab it and head
up through the next door.

-- D2 - There's another key that requires the Stepladder in here. Nothing to
be done about it now, so ignore the Wizzrobes and Like Likes and head through
the door to the right.

-- D3 - MINIBOSS - Manhandla. Bomb the Manhandla to death and it will drop five
rupees for you. Head up through the next door.

-- C3 - There's a tone of Keese in here. Kill them and then go down the stairs.
Kill more Keese in the basement and head up the other flight of stairs.

-- B2 - Kill or ignore the five Vires in here and head through the locked door
on the left to the Boss.

Well, it's Gleeok again. And this time he's got three heads, which makes him
tougher, so I hope you're ready for a fight cause... well, it's the same shit
different heads. He's heading for a bruising.

  |  - In this specific case we're dealing with a three-head Gleeok. The    |
  |    three heads will shoot fireballs at you.                             |
  |  - Once you separate a head, the head will turn red and fly around the  |

  |  - If you don't, you'll have to get in close and just trade blows with  |
  |    him. Be consistent with your attacks and Gleeok will die before you  |
  |    do.                                                                  |

  |  Gleeok is basically just a multi-headed, more annoying version of      |
  |  Aquamentus. Use your sword beams from range if you have full health,   |
  |  otherwise get in close and trade blows with it. You should be coming   |
  |  out the other side in no time.                                         |
   \_______________________________________________________________________/

It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong. Once Gleeok bites it, grab the -=HEART
CONTAINER=- and head up to the next room. Grab the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- to warp
back to the Overworld.

We've got a quick errand to run before continuing to the Wizard Hat Labyrinth.
And it's one you're gonna really be happy about: Now that we've spelled ZELDA
(and have 12 hearts but more so the ZELDA thing), we can get the Magical Sword!
Unfortunately, since we still don't have the Stepladder, we're going to have to
take a hike to get it.

From the Z Labyrinth entrance: raft south then head south one, west two (get
some Potion if you need), south one, west two (bottom path), north one, ULDL
(up, left, down, left), north three, east three, north one (right stairs), east
two, north one (either stairs), east two, north up the stairs, and then
east two to a screen with rocks in the shape of an arrow. Phew!

Push the fair left rock (tip of the arrow) up or down. Use the map for help.

Head down the stairs that appear to find the Old Man with the -=MAGICAL
SWORD=- for you.

           "M A S T E R   U S I N G   I T   A N D   Y O U   C A N
                            H A V E   T H I S."

So, take your new blade and enjoy the merge onto easy street. That's all for
our worldly errands, so now we just have to get to the Wizard Hat Labyrinth.
From A11, head west two, south down the stairs, west two, south down the
stairs, and west three to D1. Play the Recorder here and a tombstone will turn

into stairs. Head down to enter the Labyrinth.

-- H4 - No other choice but to head up through the next door.

-- G4 - Light this room with the Blue Candle. There's two Yellow Wizzrobes and
three Blue Wizzrobes. Kill them and they'll drop some bombs. Go up.

-- F4 - Ignore everything in here and quickly go left.

-- F3 - Kill the three Vires if you want and continue left through the locked
door.

-- F2 - Ignore everything in here and quickly continue left.

-- F1 - Watch out for Traps as you enter! Avoid the Traps in here and push the
far left block up to reveal stairs in the top right corner. Head down and kill
the Keese then grab the -=STEPLADDER=- from the platform. Traversing just got a
whole lot easier. Head back upstairs and go back right two and then down to G3.

-- G3 - Grab the -=KEY=- in here as painlessly as you can and head back up.
Make sure you don't leave with your sword permanently disabled (drink a Potion
if you do).

-- F3 - Head right to F4.

-- F4 - Continue ignoring everything. Bomb the top wall and head through.

-- E4 - Ignore everything in here and continue left.

-- E3 - Watch out for Traps as you enter! Get on the island and kill all four
Like Likes in here to get the -=MAP=-. Continue up through an illusion wall.

-- D3 - Ignore everything in here and bomb the right wall. Continue through the
hole. While you're doing that, ponder this interesting tidbit of trivia: when
"Zelda II: Hope You Like Darknuts" tested poorly, they remarketed it as "Zelda
II: Wizzrobe Boogaloo" which was once again a big hit with the masochists and
even got some of the sadist crowd behind it as well. But ultimately not enough,
and we were left with Second Quest once and for all.

-- D4 - Grab the -=COMPASS=- and head back to the left.

-- D3 - While continuing to ignore everything in here, head up now.

-- C3 - Breath a sigh of relieve that it's just six Vires in here. Kill them
all while somehow taking damage and continue right through an illusion wall.

-- C4 - This is a nice little room full of Blue Bubbles. Push the left-most
block in the middle row up to open a stairway in the top right corner. Head
down and kill the Keese as you head up the other stairs.

-- A4 - Kill all of the Keese in here and the bomb the bottom wall. Continue
through.

-- B4 - Grab the -=KEY=- to your left quickly and go back up.

-- A4 - Now continue through the locked door on the right.

-- A5 - MINIBOSS - Gleeok. Just a two-headed Gleeok but we have to kill it. Do
what you do best (or at least adequately) and dispatch it. You'll be rewarded
with five rupees (yay) and the door to the right will open. Continue right.

-- A6 - Have fun with this. Avoid the swarm of Red Bubbles and push the left-
most block up to reveal a staircase. If you have a Potion handy, you can just
take the Red Bubble hit and use your Potion to bring your sword back. Head down
and kill the Keese before continuing up the other side.

-- C6 - Ignore the Manhandla and continue up to the Boss.

Once again, we face my favorite boss of the game: Gohma. The lovely crustacean
has gotten all dolled up for us this time in her nicest shade of blue shell.
Now, I really do actually genuinely hope that you're definitely ready for a
fight this time cause... well, she's just as easy as she always ways. Let's
abide by the claw.

  |                                                                         |
  |  - Strafe and use your shield to block all of the incoming fireballs.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Wait for Gohma to descend from the top and open her eye, then shoot  |
  |    her in the eye with an Arrow. She'll die from one shot.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you're out of rupees (and thus arrows), you literally can't use   |
  |    anything else, so find some rupees ASAP.                             |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Gohma's a crabby bitch that hangs in the back and peppers you with     |
  |  fire. Teach her a lesson by shooting her in the eye with an arrow.     |
  |  You should be able to kill her almost as soon as you walk through the  |
  |  door so she's a quick one.                                             |
   \_______________________________________________________________________/

Once she's been sufficiently blinded, grab the -=HEART CONTAINER=- and head up
through the door. Get the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- to warp out of here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, we have just one more Heart Container to pick up. So, make your way back
to the origin point (I find it easiest to warp to E Labyrinth and head down),
then go all the way east to H16 and north two to F16. Use the Stepladder to
grab the -=HEART CONTAINER=- off the wood platform.

With that out of the way, we're free to head on to the Spiral Labyrinth, which
is actually Level 8, and I do have a reason for this. That reason is that the
Spiral Labyrinth is easier than the Apostrophe Labyrinth, and we'll get the
Magic Wand, Magical Key, AND a Bomb Upgrade that will help us to tackle the
Apostrophe Labyrinth easier. And lastly, it's my guide and you have to do what
I say.

SO, we need to have 100 RUPEES AND MONSTER BAIT for Spiral Labyrinth, so make
sure you have at least 160 (better to max out honestly) and head to the Blue
Ring shop at A15. Buy some -=MONSTER BAIT=- for 60 rupees and then warp back to
E Labyrinth and head east one, north one, west one, north one, and then east
two to B10 (B9 has a Potion Shop if you bomb the north wall -=FOUR TILES=- from
the right, so grab some potion if you need). Use the Stepladder to cross the
river and bomb the north wall -=5 TILES=- from the left. Use the map for help.

Once you've got Monster Bait, have 100 rupees, and have bombed the wall, head
through the opening to the Spiral Labyrinth.

Once again, we face three Dodongos for the final boss. Stone Statues in all
four corners. But get ready for a fight this time cause... nothing. Cause
nothing. They're friggin Dodongos. Let's fossilize these guys.

  |  - As the Dodongo walks around the room, lay a bomb in its path. As it  |
  |    walks over the bomb, it will eat it and then the bomb will explode   |
  |    inside it. Do this twice and the Dodongo will perish.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If for whatever reason the Dodongo doesn't eat your bomb, the smoke  |
  |    will still stun it and you can run up and slash him to bits during   |
  |    that window.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Summary:                                                               |

  |  Dodongo is probably the easiest boss in this game. Drop bombs in his   |
  |  path twice or stun him with smoke and hack away with your sword. This  |
  |  is an easy win so dispatch them and I'll see you on the other side.    |
   \_______________________________________________________________________/

Why they made the absolute easiest boss in the game the boss of the last
Labyrinth is beyond me, but once they're dead, grab the -=HEART CONTAINER=- and
head up through the next door. Pick up the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- to be warped out.

Nothing to do but head to our last Labyrinth. So, from the Spiral Labyrinth,
head west two, south one, east one, south four, and east four to G13. Equip the
Blue Candle and burn the bush where there's just a row of two. Use the map for
help.

It's a bit of a pain in the arse, cause you need to be on the right side to
burn the bush and then go around to the left side to go down the stairs.
Anyway, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 50 RUPEES and head down the stairs to enter the
Apostrophe Labyrinth.

-- G2 - Look at the map. Look at it. What the hell shape is that supposed to
be? I dunno. So, I picked apostrophe. Right then, head left.

-- G1 - Watch out for Traps as soon as you enter! Kill the two Zols in here and
grab the -=COMPASS=-. Head back right to the Entrance and go right.

-- G3 - Nothing to get here, continue right.

-- G4 - Also nothing to get here, continue right avoiding the Red Bubbles.

-- G5 - Kill the three Gibdos, two Red Darknuts, and Blue Darknut here. Push
the third block from the top in the left structure to reveal stairs.

Go down the stairs, kill the Keese, and continue up the other side.

-- A3 - Kill the Keese in here and go down through the door.

-- B3 - Two Pols Voices, two Red Darknuts, and one Blue Darknut in here. Kill
them all and push the left block in the middle group up. Go down the stairs
that appear. Kill the Keese in the basement and grab the -=RED CANDLE=- from
the platform. Go back upstairs and back up to A3 and through the stairs to G5.

-- G5 - Now go through the door on the right.

-- G6 - MINIBOSS - Manhandla. Kill the Manhandla and push the left most stone
up to open the doors. Continue right.

-- G7 - Use the Red Candle to light the room and kill the four Darknuts (two
red/two blue). Continue up.

-- F7 - Kill the Darknuts in here (two red/two blue) and the -=MAP=- will
appear. Grab it and continue up while avoiding Red Bubbles.

-- E7 - Avoid the fireballs from the Stone Statues and kill the five Blue
Darknuts in here. The door above will open and you'll get five rupees to
compensate for the multiple hearts you probably just lost.

-- D7 - Ignore the Darknuts in here and continue up.

-- C7 - MINIBOSS - Blue Gohma. Kill Gohma quickly and continue up.

-- B7 - Watch out for Traps as you enter! Kill the Keese in here and push the
leftmost block up to open the top right stairs. Head down to the basement.
Kill the Keese and continue up the other side.

-- E4 - There's EIGHT Blue Darknuts in here. Say "hell no" to that and head up.

-- D4 - Push the central block up and go right.

-- D5 - Pay the Thief his 50 rupees and go down.

Once again, we face a Gleeok, just with four heads no. I'm curious as to why
Manhandla was never an actual boss in Second Quest, but oh well. Not my chair,
not my problem. Let's not lose our heads here.

  |  - In this specific case we're dealing with a three-head Gleeok. The    |
  |    three heads will shoot fireballs at you.                             |
  |  - Once you separate a head, the head will turn red and fly around the  |
  |    room shooting fireballs at you.                                      |

  |                                                                         |
  |  - Make sure you've got a decent bit of health going into the fight.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you have full health, use your sword beams from range to do the   |
  |    bulk of the work.                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you don't, you'll have to get in close and just trade blows with  |
  |    him. Be consistent with your attacks and Gleeok will die before you  |
  |    do.                                                                  |

  |  - I know that's not much of a strategy but don't blame me, blame the   |
  |    game designers.                                                      |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Gleeok is basically just a multi-headed, more annoying version of      |
  |  Aquamentus. Use your sword beams from range if you have full health,   |
  |  otherwise get in close and trade blows with it. You should be coming   |
  |  out the other side in no time.                                         |
   \_______________________________________________________________________/

And just like that, you triumph again. No number of heads can keep you down.
Grab the -=HEART CONTAINER=- and continue left. Take the -=TRIFORCE PIECE=- to
warp back to the Overworld.

And just like that, we've conquered all eight Labyrinths once again. I say "we"
but really you did it, I just typed all these meaningless words. Well the only
thing left from here is to kick Ganon's teeth in once more. Recorder Warp to
C3 and head south down the stairs, east one, north (right stairs), east one,
north up the stairs, west one, north up the stairs, west three to A1. Bomb
the north wall four tiles in on the path to reveal the entrance to Ganon's
Labyrinth. Use the map for help.

There's a Potion Shop at A3 if you bomb the north wall three tiles to the right
of the stairs, so make sure you're stocked up on Potion. When you're ready,
enter the Labyrinth.

-- H5 - You may be surprised to see that the Second Quest Death Mountain is
less complicated than in First Quest. Well, don't look a gift horse in the
mouth too long and head up.

-- G5 - All the sealed doors will open since we've completed the eight other
Labyrinths. Head up first.

-- F5 - Watch out for Traps as you enter! Kill the two Zols if you want and
head right through the illusion wall.

-- F6 - Ignore the Keese and continue to the right.

-- F7 - Ignore the Wizzrobes (as best you can) and bomb the top wall. Continue
through.

-- E7 - Kill the Patra in here and it will drop the -=MAP=-. Grab it and head
left through the illusion wall.

-- E6 - Kill the two Yellow Wizzrobes and three Blue Wizzrobes in there then
push the only block left to reveal stairs. Head down, kill the Keese, and grab
the -=SILVER ARROWS=-. Head back upstairs and go up through an illusion wall.

-- D6 - Avoid the Red Bubbles and push the left block. Head down the stairs
that open, kill the Keese, and go up the other side.

-- H4 - Ignore the Wizzrobes here and bomb the north wall while avoiding the
Red Bubbles. Continue up.

-- G4 - Kill the two ultrafast Lanmolas to open the sealed doors. They'll leave
you some bombs if you need them. Continue left.

-- G3 - Watch out for Traps as you enter! Ignore the Like Likes in here and
continue left.

-- G2 - Ignore the numerous Vires and head up.

-- F2 - Light things up with the Red Candle and kill the Keese in here. Go up
through the locked door.

-- E2 - Push the central block up and bomb the left wall. Continue through.

-- E1 - Immediately go right back to E2.

-- E2 - Push the block to the right now and head up through the door.

-- D2 - Watch out for Traps as you enter! Ignore the Wizzrobes and immediately
head right.

-- D3 - Killing everything in here will get us a Key. But we don't need Keys.
So, ignore all that garbage and bomb the south wall. Continue through.

-- E3 - Kill the five Zols in here and grab the -=COMPASS=-. Return up to the
chaos room.

-- D3 - Ignoring everything still, bomb the top wall and go through.

-- C3 - Ignore the six Blue Wizzrobes here and go through the locked door to
the right.

-- C4 - It's tough but avoid the Wizzrobes and Like Likes in here, especially
the Like Likes, and go up through the door.

-- B4 - The Old Man tells you to go to the next room, so continue left through
the illusion wall.

-- B3 - Avoid the Like Likes in here and continue left.

-- B2 - Ignore the Wizzrobes in here and continue up.

-- A2 - Avoid the Patra and go left through the illusion wall.

-- A1 - Kill the two Lanmolas here and push the left block. Head down the
stairs that open, kill the Keese, and get the -=RED RING=-. Head back upstairs
and go back through the illusion wall to the right.

-- A2 - Now we gotta kill the Patra. Do your worst to it and once its dead,
push the left block and continue down the stairs. Kill the Keese and go up the
other side.

-- B6 - Immediately bomb the right wall before the Wizzrobes kick your ass and
go through.

-- B7 - Take down the Patra in here and the door the right will open. Head
through to fight Ganon!

And we're back to fight Ganon again. Guess he didn't have enough of getting
stomped the first time around. That's okay, I like bacon enough for seconds.

  |  - You CAN walk on the black parts of this room. The tiles are just for |
  |    decoration. The whole room is solid.                                 |

  |  - While Ganon is fighting like a bitch and being invisible, you gotta  |

  |    appear briefly and then disappear again. Do this four times.         |

  |  Ganon's a chump. Whack around blindly with the sword until you hit him |
  |  four times then shoot him with a silver arrow. He's no real threat at  |
  |  all which kinda leaves you wondering how Hyrule ever got into this     |
  |  mess in the first place.                                               |
   \_______________________________________________________________________/
  
That's right. The fight with Ganon is the exact same as in First Quest. Once
you've killed him, grab the Triforce once more from his pile of ashes and head
up through the door.

The following maps were made to be used in tandem with this guide. I highly
suggest you print them out or open them in a separate window so that you can
always refer back to them. Every part of this walkthrough will consistently
refer back to the map for ease of navigational directions. You'll notice the
map is a grid made up of different coordinates (i.e. A1, A2, B1, etc.). I will
use these coordinates to describe areas throughout the walkthrough, and that is
in reference to this map! Are you getting that the map is important? It's
pretty much the only way to write a decent walkthrough for this game without
giving you a bunch of lefts, ups, and downs. The map is 8 rows by 16 columns.
The rows are letters and the columns are numbers, hence the coordinate naming
system.

So, you've beaten the game and then beaten the Second Quest and then done
everything possible and you still want some more? Well, then the Pro Challenge
just might be for you. The Pro Challenge, also known as the Three Heart
Challenge, is the ultimate test of strength and skill for any Zelda player. If
this seems too hard, I advise you to pass it up and do something more fun. It
is elegantly simple and brutally hard. So, let's dig in.

+------------------+
|--= CONDITIONS =--|
+------------------+

The conditions for the Pro Challenge are as follows:

   Keep the Wooden Sword the entire time.
   Never get a Heart Container.
   Never lose a single life.
   Don't get the Blue or Red Ring.
   Get the Map and Compass in every dungeon.

For an added bonus, you could also choose to not get the Magic Key, which would
force you to actually get keys in Death Mountain, but you don't have to add
that caveat. There are some out there who say the Pro Challenge includes not
using the Wooden Sword. Those people are stupid. It's a Pro Challenge, not an
Impossible Challenge. It's plenty hard enough even with Wooden Sword.

So that doesn't sound too bad to you, eh? Well alright then, let's go over some
tips for completing it.

+-------------------------+
|--= BOSS & ENEMY TIPS =--|
+-------------------------+

Aquamentus: Range is your friend. Arrows/Sword Beams.

Dodongo: Gotta use the bombs, just be careful.

Manhandla: Range. You seeing a trend here?

Gleeok: Practice your Matrix skills and stay at range.

Digdogger: Play that funky Recorder, white boy. And then throw the shit out of
your Boomerang.

Gohma: Normal strategy is the pro strategy: Arrows.

Ganon: Godspeed, my friend. There's no strategy to Ganon other than the normal
strategy. Do your best to stay alive and dodge his fireballs.

Darknut: Bombs.

Wizzrobe: Bombs. Or Blue to Yellow Wizzrobe trick.

Remember: if it isn't 100% necessary to fight something, DON'T fight it. Just
skip it and move on. The Boomerang is really handy since it stuns enemies.

+-------------------+
|--= FIRST QUEST =--|
+-------------------+

Clear Eagle, Moon, and Manji, getting their items. Go to Snake and get the
Stepladder then leave. Go to Lizard and get the Flute then leave. Clear Dragon
and get the Magic Wand. Clear Demon and get the Red Candle. Clear Lion and get
the Magic Book. Now return to Snake and Lizard and clear the bosses. Head to 
Death Mountain and whoop Ganon.

+--------------------+
|--= SECOND QUEST =--|
+--------------------+

Clear E and get the Boomerang. Go to A and get the Recorder then leave. Go to
Wizard's Hat and get the Stepladder then leave. Clear Morning Star and grab the
Magic Wand. Now go back and clear everything else in order: L, D, Z, Wizard's
Hat, Spiral. From there, head to Ganon's Labyrinth and kill the bastard.

+------------------+
|--= IN SUMMARY =--|
+------------------+

Heed my words: this challenge is hard as heck. Seriously don't do it if you
think you will fail; it can be super frustrating. It would be seriously
unfortunate for you to burn yourself out on this great game trying to complete
a silly made-up challenge. The strategies don't change, so you can't really
ask for help. It's just a matter of skill.

If you choose to attempt it: I salute you and good luck. If you choose to
forego it: You're wiser than the rest of us.

bosses, etc. from the game. You'll get a detailed listing for each individual
entry saying what it is, how to get it (or how to kill it), and a nice little
description. So if you're playing this game and you don't really want a full
walkthrough, you just want to know "what the heck is a Recorder and how do I
get it?", well this section should help you with that. Or if you just want to
know what things are actually called so you can stop calling Like Likes "tubey
guys", this section can help you with that, too.

/__\/__\===============================================================/__\/__\

Below I will catalog ALL of the weapons and items that you will get and use in
this game, their various uses, how to use them, and how to get them. As a quick
note: the difference between Items and Equipment is that Items are something
you equip and use, Equipment is something that you just have on that provides
some sort of status or effect.

+---------------+
|--= WEAPONS =--|
+---------------+

NAME: WOODEN SWORD
USE: Slash enemies to bits.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Obtained from the Old Man in the cave on the starting screen at
the very beginning of the game.
DESCRIPTION: The Wooden Sword is the very first weapon you receive in the game,
and it's pretty dang crappy (just try to kill a Like Like with it). So,
ideally, you won't be using it for very long.

---------------

NAME: WHITE SWORD
USE: A sword that is twice as powerful as the Wooden Sword.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Once you have six or more hearts, you can talk to the Old Man
in a cave in Grid A11 and he will give you the White Sword.
DESCRIPTION: The White Sword is the sword that will get you through just about
the entire game. Considering that, it's quite effective for what you need
until you can get the Magical Sword.

---------------

NAME: MAGICAL SWORD
USE: A sword that is twice as powerful as the White Sword.
HOW TO OBTAIN: In First Quest, it is found at Grid C2 underneath a
tombstone. In Second Quest, it is found at Grid A1--0 by pushing the rock at the
tip of the arrow made of rocks.
DESCRIPTION: The most powerful sword in the game. A whopping four times more
powerful than the starting Wooden Sword, it absolutely decimates pretty much
anything that could get in your way about Hyrule. You can only obtain it after
you've obtained 12 hears on your life meter, but once you do: your life will be
a lot easier.

+-------------+
|--= ITEMS =--|
+-------------+

NAME: BLUE CANDLE
USE: Burn secret bushes to reveal passageways and the like.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Purchased for 60 Rupees from Shop One.
DESCRIPTION: The Blue Candle adds to the exploration playstyle if you want to
explore everything this game has to offer but is not necessary to just beat the
game. Still, it's pretty useful to burn down things that are blocking your
path. You can only use it once per screen though, so if you need to use it
again, you must exit and reenter.

---------------

NAME: BOMB
USE: Blow up walls, rocks, or enemies.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Dropped from defeated enemies or purchased from Shop Two or
Four.
DESCRIPTION: Bombs are perhaps THE Zelda item. They're perhaps more used as
exploration tools than weapons despite their damaging payload. They can be used
to bomb rocks and walls to reveal secret areas. You can carry 8 at a time. Bomb
Upgrades will allow you to carry 12 and then 16 later in the game.

---------------

NAME: BOOMERANG
USE: Stun enemies/Kill weaker enemies
HOW TO OBTAIN: In Eagle/E Labyrinth.
DESCRIPTION: The Boomerang is a nice weapon to have, especially for dispatching
Keese and other pesky enemies that move continuously. It can also stun larger
enemies to keep them in place while you inflict more damage with your sword.

---------------

NAME: BOW AND ARROW
USE: Shot enemies with arrows while remaining at a relatively safe distance.
HOW TO OBTAIN: From Eagle Labyrinth on the First Quest and Z Labyrinth on the
Second Quest. Arrows can be purchased from Shop Two and Four. Silver
Arrows are found in the Boss Level.
DESCRIPTION: The ultimate projectile weapon, as useful to Link as even his
sword perhaps. Once acquired, it'll be a B Box mainstay and you'll rarely have
reason to use much else. Once you get arrows, you have as much ammo as you have
rupees (firing one arrow costs one rupee). The Silver Arrow is pretty much just
a glorified regular arrow and is only used to kill Ganon.

---------------

NAME: LETTER
USE: Unlocks the ability to buy Potions from Potion Shops.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Found at Grid A15 in First quest and Grid B2 in Second Quest.
DESCRIPTION: The Letter literally has a single use: give it to an Old Lady in a
Potion Shop and they will all start selling Potion to you, enabling you to
essentially carry extra health with you from that point on.

---------------

NAME: MAGIC BOOMERANG
USE: A stronger version of the regular boomerang that flies farther.
HOW TO OBTAIN: In Moon Labyrinth on First Quest and L Labyrinth on Second Quest
by defeating a specific set of Blue Goriyas.
DESCRIPTION: It's pretty much identical to the regular Boomerang other than
being able to fly farther and doing a bit more damage. That's it.

---------------

NAME: MAGICAL WAND
USE: Shoot magical energy across any room to inflict serious damage to
everything except Wizzrobes.
HOW TO OBTAIN: In Dragon Labyrinth in First Quest and Morning Star Labyrinth in
Second Quest.
DESCRIPTION: The Magical Wand is the most powerful weapon in the game (that's
not a sword). Its bolts do more damage and travel faster than the Bow and
Arrow and you don't need to refill your ammo constantly. Unfortunately,
Wizzrobes are immune to it since they use the same weapon.

---------------

NAME: POTION
USE: Replenish health.
HOW TO OBTAIN: From Potion Shops after the Old Man Letter has been delivered
to one.
DESCRIPTION: Potions are absolutely must-have items once you've unlocked the
ability to buy them. Both Red and Blue Potions heal you the same amount, but
Red Potions can be consumed twice and a Blue Potion can only be consumed once.

---------------

NAME: MONSTER BAIT
USE: Used to bait Goriyas.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Purchased from Shop Three or Shop Four.
DESCRIPTION: Monster bait really servers one purpose and one purpose only: bait
Goriyas away from their path-blocking resting spots so that you can progress.
That's pretty much it, but it works for what it does.

---------------

NAME: RECORDER
USE: Shrink Digdogger and warp to various locations.
HOW TO OBTAIN: In Lizard Labyrinth in First Quest and A Labyrinth in Second
Quest.
DESCRIPTION: In First Quest, the Recorder is only used to kill Digdoggers,
uncover a Labyrinth, and warp to entrances of various Labyrinths where you
have defeated the boss already. But once you start the Second Quest, it gains
the ability to uncover secret staircases through Hyrule (hint: these secret
staircases are where many of the new locations for various helpful things have
been moved to for Second Quest).

---------------

NAME: RED CANDLE
USE: A supped up version of the Blue Candle.
HOW TO OBTAIN: In Demon/Spiral Labyrinth.
DESCRIPTION: The Red Candle removes the once per screen limitation of the Blue
Candle so that you can use it as much as you like/need to without needing to
exit and reenter. That being said, you'll never convince me that the only
reason that was a limitation of the Blue Candle in the first place was so they
could put the Red Candle in the game for a low-effort Labyrinth reward.

+-----------------+
|--= EQUIPMENT =--|
+-----------------+

NAME: BLUE RING
USE: Reduces incoming damage to Link by half.
HOW TO OBTAIN: At Grid D5 in the First Quest and at Grid A16 in the Second
Quest for 250 Rupees.
DESCRIPTION: The Blue Ring is absolutely NECESSARY. Pinch those rupees and make
sure you get it. You can pretty easily acquire it before going to even the
first Labyrinth. With the Blue Ring equipped, enemies will inflict half the
amount of damage they inflicted before having the ring. Once the ring is
equipped, it will turn Link's tunic blue, so you'll know it's working.

---------------

NAME: MAGIC BOOK
USE: Makes the Magical Wand shoot a more powerful blast: a FIRE blast.
HOW TO OBTAIN: In Lion Labyrinth in First Quest and D Labyrinth in Second
Quest.
DESCRIPTION: NOW THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE! Gives the Magical Wand a huge power
up, making it do even more damage. The Magical Wand + Magic Book is definitely
not necessary for your playthrough but it's a very powerful and convenient
weapon, so I suggest going through the effort to get it.

---------------

NAME: MAGIC KEY
USE: A regular key that can be used repeatedly, removing the need to find keys
entirely.
HOW TO OBTAIN: In Lion/Morning Star Labyrinth.
DESCRIPTION: The Magic Key is nice. Once you get it, you don't have to find
keys anymore, since the Magic Key works on every door. Too bad you find it in
the last Labyrinth and basically have no more locked doors to deal with anyway.

---------------

NAME: MAGICAL SHIELD
USE: Bother larger and more reinforced than the Wooden Shield.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Can be purchased from Shops One, Two, Three, or Four.

DESCRIPTION: The Magical Shield gives you the ability to block fireballs that
are thrown at you by enemies. However, be forewarned: this does not seem to
apply to Bosses. Also, Like Likes will eat your Magical Shield if they get
ahold of you.

---------------

NAME: POWER BRACELET
USE: Gives Link the ability to push, lift, and move large rocks and boulders
around Hyrule.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Found at Grid C5.
DESCRIPTION: Another must-have (boy, sure seems like just about every item is a
must-have *cough cough*) for your travels. Once you get it, you'll be able to
move large rocks and boulders which will make exploration and secret-finding
easier. You'll need it eventually so might as well get it as soon as possible,
right?

---------------

NAME: RAFT
USE: Allows you to cross bodies of water without a bridge.
HOW TO OBTAIN: In Manji Labyrinth in First Quest and D Labyrinth in Second
Quest.
DESCRIPTION: The raft simply makes traversal and exploration easier by giving
you the ability to cross bodies of water from whatever point you need to. It's
also necessary since it's the only way to get to the Snake Labyrinth.

---------------

NAME: RED RING
USE: Reduces incoming damage for Link by 75%.
HOW TO OBTAIN: In Final Boss Labyrinth.
DESCRIPTION: It's found in Death Mountain before your final fight with Ganon.
Absolutely get it, it makes the fight just that much easier. It also turns
Link's tunic red, which is a nice look if you like the color red.

---------------

NAME: STEPLADDER
USE: Allows you to cross bodies of water one square long.
HOW TO OBTAIN: In Snake Labyrinth in First Quest and Wizard's Hat Labyrinth in
Second Quest.
DESCRIPTION: The Stepladder is a step down from the Raft (so then it's rather
odd that you get it after the raft, but whatever I guess). It allows you to
cross the rivers in the game without needing to break out the Raft, but can't
be used for bodies of water larger than a single square. It's also a necessary
item in order to complete the Snake Labyrinth so it must be acquired!

---------------

NAME: WOODEN SHIELD
USE: Deflect projectiles and incoming attacks.
HOW TO OBTAIN: You start the game with it.
DESCRIPTION: The starter shield and not a very good one at that. It'll block
most solid incoming projectiles and that's about it. It won't block fire/energy
blasts and most boss attacks. Best to upgrade to a Magical Shield sooner rather
than later.

+--------------------+
|--= COMMON ITEMS =--|
+--------------------+

NAME: RUPEES
USE: Rupees are the in-game currency used to buy items from shops.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Rupees are dropped by enemies. Large sums of rupees can be found
in hidden areas.
DESCRIPTION: There are two types of rupees: Gold and Blue. Gold Rupees are
worth one unit and Blue Rupees are worth five. Blue Rupees are much rarer to
have drop from an enemy, but it does happen.

---------------

NAME: HEART
USE: Refills a single heart container.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Defeated enemies will drop them.
DESCRIPTION: A single, flashing heart icon that is drop by enemies when you
defeat them. They replenish one heart container, which can be useful in a
pinch. They drop about as frequently as gold rupees.

---------------

NAME: FAIRY
USE: Refills multiple heart containers at once.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Very rare drop from defeated enemies.
DESCRIPTION: Fairies are living sprites whose sole purpose is to refill your
health so that you can keep fighting the good fight. When they are dropped by
an enemy, they will fly around the screen and you have to catch them.

---------------

NAME: STOPWATCH
USE: The Stopwatch freezes all of the enemies on screen.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Stopwatches are a rare drop from defeated enemies.
DESCRIPTION: The Stopwatch can be very useful if it is dropped for you. Once
picked up, it will freeze all of the enemies around you so that you can easily
defeat them without having to worry about a counter. Link will flash when time
is frozen. Time will remain frozen until you leave the screen.

+-----------------------+
|--= LABYRINTH ITEMS =--|
+-----------------------+

NAME: MAP
USE: See the full layout of the Labyrinth.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Each Labyrinth has a map. They are hidden in various places in
their respective Labyrinths.
DESCRIPTION: The map is probably the most important item that you can find
in the Labyrinth. It's essential to know the layout of the Labyrinth and where
you are in it. Finding the map should be your first objective if you're
attempting to conquer the Labyrinth on your own.

---------------

NAME: COMPASS
USE: Shows the location of the boss on the map.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Each Labyrinth has a compass. They are hidden in various places
in their respective Labyrinths.
DESCRIPTION: The compass may not be as essential as the map, but it's always
useful to know where the boss is. You should search for the compass after
finding the map.

---------------

NAME: KEY
USE: Opens regular locked doors.
HOW TO OBTAIN: Found in various places in Labyrinths. They can also be bought
from Shop One or Five.
DESCRIPTION: The Key is necessary to progress completely through every
Labyrinth. If you are having trouble finding a key in a Labyrinth, you can
always go buy one, but make sure you look for it. Every Labyrinth has enough
hidden keys to open all of its locked doors.

   /\=====================================================================/\
  /__\-----------------------={  E N E M I E S  }=-----------------------/__\
 /\  /\                             [ENEMY]                             /\  /\
/__\/__\===============================================================/__\/__\

There are many enemies that you will come up against as you fight your way
through the land of Hyrule to face down Ganon once and for all. I've listed all
of them below along with their description, where you'll find them, and the
best strategy for dispatching them.

[enemies are in alphabetical order for the preservation of my own sanity]

+-------------+
|--= Armos =--|
+-------------+

DESCRIPTION: "A solider who has been turned into a stone statue. He moves and
attacks if touched by Link. He has a fair amount of attack power."
LOCATION: Overworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Really, you don't even have to fight them. They only wake up
if you attack them so they can be skipped entirely. They usually are in large
packs and you'll have to be careful to not touch any of them. If you do wake
one up, the best strategy is the slash/run/slash strategy. Hit him, run away,
hit him again.

+--------------+
|--= Bubble =--|
+--------------+

DESCRIPTION: "The spirit of the dead. When it clings onto Link, he won't be
able to unsheathe his sword for a while."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Another enemy that's better left alone. You can't damage it
with your sword, since touching it renders you incapable of using your sword at
all. There is no way to kill them.
In Second Quest, there are two new types of Bubbles: Red and Blue. Red Bubbles
will take away your sword PERMANENTLY. Blue Bubbles will give your sword back.
So, if you get hit by a Red Bubble, you have to find a Blue Bubble immediately.
Additionally, Fairy Ponds, Potion, and Triforce Segments will return the use of
your sword.

+---------------+
|--= Darknut =--|
+---------------+

DESCRIPTION: "The knight who lives in the labyrinths. He has lots of attacking
power. He repels Link's attacks from the front with his shield."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: You'll start to encounter these guys about halfway through the
game, but they're really not that tough to beat. You can't attack them head on,
since they're VERY effective with their shields, so you need to get around them
to the side or behind them and take some shots then. Two hits with the White
Sword is enough to take them out. Be warned, they will often change direction
randomly and run into you while you're trying to skirt around them. They won't
actively attack you but running into them will still do damage to the tune of
one full heart with no rings equipped. 

+-----------+
|--= Gel =--|
+-----------+

DESCRIPTION: "Jelly-like monsters that walk about bouncing around in the
labyrinths. When Link cuts Zol, it splits into two Gels. Gel has little
attacking power, but Zol has twice the power of Gels."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: These little slimy bastards can't really do much of anything
but bounce around and get killed. They have virtually no attack power and it
only takes one slash with the Wooden Sword to take them out. So, kill them and
grab whatever they drop.

+-------------+
|--= Ghini =--|
+-------------+

DESCRIPTION: "The ghost who lives in the graveyard. There are two types. There
are Ghinis who are there from the beginning of the game, and those who appear
when Link touches the gravestones. Ghinis have about the same attacking force
as Armos."
LOCATION: Overworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Ghinis are found only in the graveyards around Hyrule, so you
don't have to worry about bumping into one anywhere else. That being said, they
are one of the more difficult enemies you'll face in this game. They move slow
and don't have much of an attack, but if you touch them it'll inflict a fair
amount of damage. They can also take quite a walloping, so just whack them
around until they die and try to not touch them. They often drop rupees and
other valuables, so they're worth killing if you're strapped for cash.

+-------------+
|--= Gibdo =--|
+-------------+

DESCRIPTION: "The mummy man. He's got some strange powers, and some pretty
powerful attacking force."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Don't let the quote fool you, Gibdos aren't much of an
adversary. They don't have any real attacks. If they touch you, they'll do some
damage though. They move around in packs and have a fast/sporadic movement to
them, so play keep away while dealing with a group of them. Hit them with a few
slashes then back off and don't get bopped.

+--------------+
|--= Goriya =--|
+--------------+

DESCRIPTION: "A little devil that lives underground. He uses boomerangs. There
are two of his type, blue ones and red ones. Watch out for the blue ones! They
are strong."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Goriya attack the same way, regardless of their color: with
the Boomerang. And they're damn effective with it at that. The best strategy is
to keep away from their boomerang as best you can and try to get behind them to
hack away with your sword. Alternatively, the Bow and Arrow provides an
effective strategy for damage while staying at range. And if you're anywhere
near as good with the Boomerang as they are, you could use it to stun them and
then slash them with the sword.

+-------------+
|--= Keese =--|
+-------------+

DESCRIPTION: "Vire is a devil that controls the Keeses. When Link cuts it with
his sword, it turns into two Keeses. Keeses have little attacking power, but
Vire is a little stronger.
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Keese are very weak and very annoying. They're small and fast
and sometimes unpredictable. They're basically bats and they're always in
groups (and they tend to attack as a swarm as well). Simple slashing is the
best way to kill them, just pay attention to their flight patterns and stay on
your toes.

+---------------+
|--= Lanmola =--|
+---------------+

DESCRIPTION: "A gigantic centipede. Attack his head won't work. Boy! Does he
move fast!"
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Lanmolas are only found in the final Labyrinth, so you don't
have to worry about them until then. Though, once you do have to worry about
them, it's a damn battle. They're larger, faster, and stronger than Moldorms,
meaning they pack a punch and do so quickly. To defeat them you have to keep
hitting them with your sword to knock out segments of their body until only
the head remains and then you can kill the head (which moves very fast and is
hard to hit). 

+--------------+
|--= Leever =--|
+--------------+

DESCRIPTION: "They live in the ground and eat up the energy of creatures that
approach them. Blue Leevers are a little stronger, but the red ones don't
have much attack power."
LOCATION: Overworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Leevers are very common around Hyrule, especially in areas
with water. They dig into the ground and then come up in a completely different
area, making them difficult to keep track of. They can also take quite a few
hits to kill so it's best to avoid them until you feel like you can take them
on.

+-----------------+
|--= Like Like =--|
+-----------------+

DESCRIPTION: "A tube-like monster that has a soft spot for magic shields - he
eats them up."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: The most annoying enemy in the entire game by a fairly large
margin simply because they can wind up costing you quite a bit of money. If a
Like Like manages to touch you (and if you have a Magic Shield equipped), they
will eat your shield and you won't be able to get it back. It takes five hits
with the White Sword to kill them so be careful if you plan on engaging them.

+-------------+
|--= Lynel =--|
+-------------+

DESCRIPTION: "The guardian who attacks all those who come near Death Mountain.
Watch out! He's pretty strong, and Link's little shield can't stop his sword."
LOCATION: Overworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Basically giant beastly centaur things, Lynels are one of the
strongest enemies in the entire game. They wield swords and can shoot sword
beams at you that do a helluva lot of damage. So, they win the range game and
the power game. Early in the game, you should just avoid them. Later on, you
can better face them and they'll sometimes drop nice goodies for you.

+--------------+
|--= Moblin =--|
+--------------+

DESCRIPTION: "A bulldog-like goblin who lives in the forest. He attacks by
throwing spears. A little bit meaner than Octorok."
LOCATION: Overworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Moblins don't have much attack power and have even less
health, but they're somehow still annoying little creatures. They're real
advantage is being able to throw their spear across the entire screen with
laser accuracy. Though, their spears can be blocked with either of the game's
shields provided you're facing the correct way. A combination of blocking and
slashing is best for these guys and they'll usually drop some rupees or
something when they die.

+---------------+
|--= Moldorm =--|
+---------------+

DESCRIPTION: "The huge worm living in the labyrinths. It grows smaller as
Link attacks. Not so strong."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: A big worm thing that's got a body made of fireball looking
segments. Every hit takes away at least one segment (and one hit could take
all segments in a single slash if it's a good enough hit) until there's none
of it left. Patience is key here. Avoid getting hit as you slash away at it
and be wary of its seemingly random direction changes.

+---------------+
|--= Octorok =--|
+---------------+

DESCRIPTION: "A type of octopus that lives above ground. There are two types,
red and blue. Watch out for the blue ones. They're mean. They spit out rocks
at Link."
LOCATION: Overworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: The most generic of all the enemies, you'll find them
EVERYWHERE. The strategy here is easy: deflect their projectiles with your
shield and get close enough to whack them with your sword. Red Octoroks are
weaker than Blue Octoroks insofar as it takes less hits to kill them, but
they both have the same attack power. However, once you get the White Sword,
both Red and Blue Octoroks die from a single hit.

+-------------+
|--= Patra =--|
+-------------+

DESCRIPTION: "The Patra attack in groups, in two types of formations. Both
formation groups are strong. So be on your toes!"
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Patras are only found in the final Labyrinth of the game.
They are total pains to go up against (seriously, get the red ring) and guard
key areas of Death Mountain, so you have to fight them. They're encircled by
pieces of debris that protect them from sustaining damage until all of the
debris has been dispatched. Getting hit by the debris also inflicts quite a
bit of damage, so be careful around them. When all the debris is cleared, you
can move in and damage the eyeball to kill the Patra, which takes three hits
with the Magical Sword.

+--------------+
|--= Peahat =--|
+--------------+

DESCRIPTION: "Has little attacking power. This is the ghost of a flower that
bounces and flutters around the place. Link can eliminate it only when it's
standing still."
LOCATION: Overworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: These can be frustrating since you can only damage them when
they're not moving and they're rarely not moving. It's preferable to me to
avoid them altogether if I can, but if you want to take them out, just follow
carefully until they stop moving briefly and slash away. In my opinion, it's
way more effort than it's worth to kill these guys. And even if they do hit
you, they don't do a lot of damage.

+------------------+
|--= Pols Voice =--|
+------------------+

DESCRIPTION: "A ghost with big ears and a weak point - he hates loud noise."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Essentially a large free-moving rabbit's head that hops around
the room looking for its next victim. They will do massive damage if they
manage to touch Link, so play keep away with them. They can jump over barrier,
rivers, and other obstacles so your best bet is to kill them quickly. They're
much harder to avoid when they attack in a group, which they often do, so keep
your wits and take them out one by one before they have a chance to attack.

+------------+
|--= Rock =--|
+------------+

DESCRIPTION: "These rocks crumble off Death Mountain and fall down to attack
Link. He can't destroy these natural nuisances."
LOCATION: Overworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Do not ask me why a literal falling rock (that's really all it
is) is included in the games list of enemies, but it is. It's just a rock. You
can't fight it, you can't beat it, you can only avoid it. Good luck.

+------------+
|--= Rope =--|
+------------+

DESCRIPTION: "A poisonous snake that has made the labyrinth its home. It senses
other creatures quickly and suddenly comes after them (and Link, for that
matter!) once it has found them out. This one hasn't got a lot of attacking
power."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: You'll find Ropes in pretty much every single Labyrinth,
they're very common. They don't really have an attack and are super weak, so
you can just kill them with the sword pretty easily. They do move quite rapidly
across their rooms and are often found in groups, which can make them more
formidable. Still, you shouldn't have very many issues.
In Second Quest, there is a new type of Rope: Electrified Rope. They are the
same as normal ropes just electric and do more damage.

+---------------+
|--= Stalfos =--|
+---------------+

DESCRIPTION: "A skeleton that's got a sword in each hand. Little attacking
power."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Only in Zelda could a hopping rabbit head mess your shit up
while a dual-wielding skeleton poses very little threat. Stalfos really aren't
that tough. They do negligible damage and hardly ever attack. Instead, they
try to run into you, which also does very little damage. So smack them around
with your trusty sword and enjoy the free loot from a very non-menacing enemy.
In Second Quest, they can throw their swords at you which makes them a bit more
of a threat.

+--------------------+
|--= Stone Statue =--|
+--------------------+

DESCRIPTION: "Somebody placed these in the labyrinths a long time ago. They
suddenly attack Link when he approaches them. So you've really got to watch
out!"
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Statues can't really be killed, which makes them a royal pain
in the ass. Whenever you're in a room with them, they'll constantly pepper you
with fireballs (which can be deflected by your shield). Just get whatever you
need to get done around them done and move on.

+---------------+
|--= Tektite =--|
+---------------+

DESCRIPTION: "These spidery things jump all over the place. Red ones move about
a lot and blue ones only move a little. Tektites have little fighting power."
LOCATION: Overworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Tektites, much like the Octoroks, are everywhere. But they're
also very easy to dispatch. They don't have projectiles or anything of that
nature, their only attack is to jump at you and hit you. Get close and take
them out with your sword.

+-------------+
|--= Traps =--|
+-------------+

DESCRIPTION: "Somebody placed these in the labyrinths a long time ago. They
suddenly attack Link when he approaches them. So you've really got to watch
out!"
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Traps are very similar to Stone Statues in that they're in
pretty much every Labyrinth and can't be defeated, or stopped, or stunned, or
affected in any way. When you walk in front of a Trap, they shoot you with
impressive speed and will do pretty dang good damage. They're especially
annoying when they're on either side of Link for a nice little sandwich effect.
The best approach to Traps is to trigger them and then move back out of the
way.

+------------+
|--= Vire =--|
+------------+

DESCRIPTION: "Vire is a devil that controls the Keeses. When Link cuts it with
his sword, it turns into two Keeses. Keeses have little attacking power, but
Vire is a little stronger."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Vires are basically larger Keese. And by that, I mean much
larger and much stronger to the point of actually posing a threat on occasion.
When they're in the room, they'll try to run into you and can actually inflict
some decent damage. When you hit them, they'll split into Red Keese that move
faster but are more easily dispatched and not as aggressive.

+-------------------+
|--= Wall Master =--|
+-------------------+

DESCRIPTION: "A monster hand that appears out of the labyrinth wall. If it
catches Link, it takes him back to the entrance of the labyrinth."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: You need to be on your guard at pretty much all times through
the Labyrinths to avoid getting nabbed by a Wall Master. They're quite fond of
rooms just before the boss area, adding that insult to the injury if they
manage to grab you. Conveniently, you don't have to do the things you've
already done if they take you to the start of the Labyrinth, it's still
generally inconvenient tracing your way back through the Labyrinth at all.
Attacking them is a gamble that rarely pays off and usually ends with you at
the start of the Labyrinth. Best to just play keep away.

+----------------+
|--= Wizzrobe =--|
+----------------+

DESCRIPTION: "The Master of Movement. He appears here and there letting out
magic spells that Link's little shield can't hold back. He's pretty strong.
Watch out!"
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: If you haven't muttered "Fuck Wizzrobes" under your breath a
dozen times by the time you're through with this game, then I don't believe you
even played it. They are the worst, quite literally. They are the most annoying
and difficult enemy in this game (and that's including the bosses on that
list). They just suck, plain and simple. They come in two versions: Red and
Blue. The Red Wizzrobe can be killed in one hit with the Magical Sword if you
can pin him down long enough but shoots devastatingly powerful magic that'll
take multiple hearts with one blow. He disappears immediately after shooting
and reappears to start the cycle again. The Blue Wizzrobe take three hits from
the Magical Sword and teleport more often, but they are more visible during
their teleportation and therefore easier to predict. Occasionally, they'll
shoot a rapid burst of magical energy at Link that'll wipe you out completely
if it gets you. The Magical Shield can block their attacks, so block their
attack and attack them quickly to stand a chance here. If you aren't on your
game with these guys they will mess your shit up and that's a promise.

+-----------+
|--= Zol =--|
+-----------+

DESCRIPTION: "Jelly-like monsters that walk about bouncing around in the
labyrinths. When Link cuts Zol, it splits into two Gels. Gel has little
attacking power, but Zol has twice the power of Gel."
LOCATION: Underworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: Zols are literally just bigger Gels, and they're just as easy.
They're a bit quicker, but it's no big deal. It's a one-hit-kill with the White
Sword and it won't even split into Gels.

+------------+
|--= Zola =--|
+------------+

DESCRIPTION: "Half-fish, half-woman who lives in the water. When she sticks her
head out of the water, she lets out a ball that Link's little shield can't hold
back."
LOCATION: Overworld.
BATTLE STRATEGY: You'll encounter the Zola fairly early on. While you 
technically can kill it with your sword, it's better to wait until you have the
Bow and Arrow to do some real damage. The Wooden Shield is incapable of
blocking the Zola's projectiles, but the Magical Shield can no problem. Just
avoid until you can take it out.

  |  - Shoots a burst of three fireballs at you. Each fireball does a       |
  |    full heart of damage with no rings equipped.                         |

  |  Strategy:                                                              |

  |  - If you have full heart containers going into the fight, just sit in  |
  |    the back and shoot sword beams at him. He'll die after a few hits.   |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - The other strategy is to wait for him to fire a volley of fireballs, |
  |    dodge the projectiles, and then run up close and slash him. In my    |
  |    opinion, this is quicker and easier than shooting sword beams.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If you have the White Sword, he'll die after three hits.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Beyond shooting fireballs, he barely even moves. He's a very         |
  |    stationary boss, so use that to your advantage when going in for     |
  |    the kill.                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Once you have the Bow and Arrow, you can just stay back and shoot    |
  |    him in the head three times.                                         |
  |                                                                         |

  |                                                                         |
  |  Summary:                                                               |

  |  Aquamentus is a very easy boss (not surprising considering he's the    |
  |  first boss of the game. Shoot him with sword beams or wait for         |
  |  fireball volley and run up to slash him. You should be able to kill    |
  |  him without much fuss and get on to other things.                      |

  |  "A giant rhinoceros. It hasn't got so much    | Received:              |

  |  - Just like the description says, the Dodongo doesn't have much        |
  |    attacking power, in that it doesn't attack at all.                   |
  |  - He just walks around the room.                                       |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Strategy:                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - The Dodongo is impervious to everything in your arsenal except bombs |
  |    but you probably guessed that cause the Labyrinth gave you bombs     |
  |    twice and you were smart enough to figure out the Old Man's clue.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - As the Dodongo walks around the room, lay a bomb in its path. As it  |
  |    walks over the bomb, it will eat it and then the bomb will explode   |
  |    inside it. Do this twice and the Dodongo will perish.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - If for whatever reason the Dodongo doesn't eat your bomb, the smoke  |
  |    will still stun it (this is what the Old Man was talking about) and  |
  |    you can run up and slash him to bits during that window.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                         |
  |  Summary:                                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |  Dodongo is probably the easiest boss in this game. Drop bombs in his   |
  |  path twice or stun him with smoke and hack away with your sword. This  |
  |  is an easy win so dispatch him and I'll see you on the other side.     |

  |  - It'll charge at you with flailing arms and give you a good whack.    |
  |  - It also shoots fireballs from every orifice, of which there are a    |
  |    good number.                                                         |

  |  - There's one surefire way to kill the Manhandla with a single blow.   |
  |    You need to drop a bomb in its path in just the right way that it    |
  |    will explode when the Manhandla is centered on it. This will blow    |
  |    all of its limbs off in one fell swoop and that'll be that. You need |
  |    to be accurate with your bombs. It's much easier said than done.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - The actual strategy here is to hack off its limbs with your sword    |
  |    (two hits per limb with the White Sword). It'll speed up as you      |
  |    delimb it until all of its arms have been cut off.                   |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Manhandla is a real slapper. Try to nail it with a bomb in dead center |
  |  to blow all its limbs off or hack away at the arms with your sword.    |
  |  It shouldn't give you too much trouble.                                |

  |    heads will shoot fireballs at you.                                   |

  |  - If you don't, you'll have to get in close and just trade blows with  |
  |    him. Be consistent with your attacks and Gleeok will die before you  |
  |    do.                                                                  |

  |  Gleeok is basically just a multi-headed, more annoying version of      |
  |  Aquamentus. Use your sword beams from range if you have full health,   |
  |  otherwise get in close and trade blows with it. You should be coming   |
  |  out the other side in no time.                                         |

  |  - Digdogger doesn't really have any attacks, it just constantly moves  |
  |    around the room. If it touches you, it will do damage.               |
  |  - Also watch out for the four statues in the corner that will be       |
  |    continuously shooting fire at you                                    |

  |  - Digdogger's strategy makes him one of the easiest bosses in the      |
  |    game. Make sure you have your Recorder equipped and play it during   |
  |    the fight.                                                           |

  |  - The Recorder melody will cause Digdogger to shrivel up to a tiny,    |
  |    much less threatening size. Once he's been shrunk down, two slashes  |
  |    with the Magical Sword will take him out.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - Digdogger moves pretty fast once it's been shrunk down. You can use  |
  |    the Boomerang to stun it and keep it in place while you whack at it. |
  |                                                                         |
  |  - You'll need to be evading the Stone Statue fireballs the entire      |
  |    time, cause they'll just keep peppering you. They're honestly a      |
  |    bigger threat that Digdogger.                                        |
  |                                                                         |

  |  Digdogger is a giant floating booger and a scaredy-cat. Play your      |
  |  Recorder to shrink it down and then hit it with a Boomerang and hack   |
  |  it to bits. A quick jam session and you'll be outta there in no time.  |

Below you will find a number of tricks that you can use to either exploit the
game to your advantage or just make it a bit more easy or convenient. Let's dig
in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        T H E   " Z E L D A "   N A M E
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In an effort to further the confusion regarding Link's name, Nintendo have seen
fit to throw this little trick in here. If you enter your player name as
"ZELDA", you will automatically skip the First Quest and start fresh on the
Second Quest. So, if you want to just skip the quite easy First Quest and get
straight to the more challenging Second Quest, that's how.

Additionally, you still have three character spaces left after "ZELDA". As long
as the first five characters spell "ZELDA" you can put whatever you like for
the last three characters and the trick will still work.

There are a few things you can do with a second controller connected (no
multiplayer, sorry).

1. While in your inventory, if you press UP + A on the Controller 2, it will
bring up the Save menu.

2. If you do the Save menu while in a Labyrinth and select "Continue", it will
take you to the beginning of the Labyrinth with three hearts.

3. You can also use the Save trick to cheat a little bit at the Gambling game.
I touch on this in the Rupee Farming section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Switch's Suspend feature can be used very usefully throughout Zelda and is
basically a one-up to the NES style save. The Suspend creates a suspended save 
of your game exactly as it is when you create the save. NOTHING will change,
not even RNG elements.

This can be used to attempt particularly difficult things over and over again.
Or it can be used to cheat like a psychic at the Gambling Game. Simply go into
a Gambling Den, then create a suspend save, pick one of the options and IF you
don't get it pay attention to which choice was the winner, reload your suspend
save and pick that choice because it won't change. Use this to guarantee a win
every time and bank up rupees fast.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clearing out all of the enemies on a single screen will cause that screen to be
empty for a bit. But after a while, the enemies will all spawn back in at once.
However, if you leave one enemy alive on a screen, then the other enemies will
never respawn (unless you die). IMPORTANT NOTE: Zolas do not contribute to this
trick.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    D A R K N U T S   &   W I Z Z R O B E S
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Darknuts and Wizzrobes are easily the two worst enemies in the game. By a lot.
But there are some tricks you can use to make them a bit less of a pain in the
ass.

Darknuts: It's always better to attack a Darknut from the side than from
behind. The odds are against you and they will often do a complete about face
when you're behind them. It's always better to be at the side. Also, Darknuts
only turn when they are on a square. Link however can stand on the tile lines.
So, you can stand on the lines and attack them from the side for a bit of an
easier time.

Wizzrobes: The safest place in all of the Legend of Zelda is the doorways
between Labyrinth rooms. You can stand in the doorway and fire your sword beams
to kill everything in the room. This goes especially for taking care of
Wizzrobes. Use this trick to take care of all the Yellow Wizzrobes in any room.
Once you've got it down to just Blue Wizzrobes, leave the room and come back.
As long as you had more than one Blue Wizzrobe in there when you left, they
will be Yellow Wizzrobes when you come back in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  T R I C K S   W I T H   A   R E C O R D E R
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Recorder is the most useful of all tools in Link's. It has a number of
magical effects when you play it.

The Recorder will heal any jinxes put on Link by flashing Bubbles.

Using the Recorder on any screen where there is not a hidden entrance will
spawn a whirlwind that will allow you to warp around Hyrule, putting you at the
entrance to any Labyrinth you've already completed. It will always warp you
to the entrance of the First Quest Labyrinths, even during the Second Quest.
This is especially useful after clearing the Z Labyrinth in Second Quest since
the Recorder will take you to the location of the Lizard Labyrinth which is
a Fairy Pond in Second Quest.

You can control where you warp to with the direction you are facing. If you
face north or east, it will take you to the next Labyrinth in the sequence
(i.e. from Eagle to Moon). If you face south or west, it will take you to the
previous Labyrinth in the sequence (i.e. from Moon to Eagle). Additionally,
playing the Recorder multiple times while the Whirlwind approaches will jump
that many sequences (i.e. face north and play the recorder three times to jump
from Eagle to Snake). Also, if you complete the dungeons out of order, the
uncompleted dungeons will be skipped automatically in the sequence.

And that's all I have to say about that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     E N E M Y   D R O P   P A T T E R N S
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are certain ways that you can attempt to control the what the enemies you
kill drop for you in an effort to curate your loot to get the things you need.
These aren't something that I found myself through trial and error (that would
take forever), though some of them are things that you will eventually notice.
Others I saw on the forums at GameFAQs and have since forgotten who the posters
where that discovered this information (Sorry! If this is you, PLEASE email me
with proof so I can give you proper credit).

+----------------------+
|--= THE 10TH ENEMY =--|
+----------------------+

There's an Old Man screen that gives you the hint "10TH ENEMY HAS THE BOMB". He
is telling you about this little trick. If you kill 10 enemies without taking
damage AND kill the tenth enemy with a bomb, then the last enemy will drop a
pack of bombs for you. It's useful (I guess?) but often more pain than it's
worth as I never really had a problem with bomb supply through either Quest.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Keese, Gels, Like Likes, Armos, Gleeok Heads, Digdoggers,
Bubbles, and Petra children do not contribute to the enemy count for this.

If you finish off the tenth enemy with anything other than a bomb, you'll get a
five-rupee piece instead (way more useful in my opinion).

+------------------------+
|--= ENEMY BOMB DROPS =--|
+------------------------+

Also dealing with bomb drops here. Bomb drops occur in a fixed pattern with the
following enemies: Blue Octoroks, Blue Moblins, Blue Lynels, Vires, Red
Darknuts, Red Goriyas, Gibdos, and Red Wizzrobes. Meaning, you can control
whether or not you receive bombs when killing these enemies. The first, sixth,
and eight kills of the enemies listed above (can chain the enemies together,
meaning you don't have to kill just one enemy variety per chain) will drop
bombs and the cycle will repeat every 10 kills.

+--------------------------------------+
|--= 16 KILLS WITHOUT TAKING DAMAGE =--|
+--------------------------------------+

If you can manage to kill 16 enemies without taking a single bit of damage, the
16th enemy will drop a Fairy as a reward. Just like the 10th Enemy trick: Keese
Gels, Like Likes, Armos, Gleeok Heads, Digdogger, Bubbles, and Petra children
do not count towards this.

+---------------------+
|--= COUNTER RESET =--|
+---------------------+

The kill counter will reset for every instance of the following:

 - the game is powered on
 - the game is reset
 - Link takes damage
 - Link dies

That's it, otherwise your counter is ticking up.

There are several good locations and methods to farm for rupees. Here we'll
cover the most effective three methods (in my opinion, which is fact).

+----------------+
|--= THE LOOP =--|
+----------------+

I cover this in the Walkthrough, but we'll go over it again here. If you head
right all the way from the origin point (H8) until you can't anymore (H16), you
will encounter a lot of lucrative and easy enemies on the way. Lots of Leevers,
Tektites, and Octoroks. The more you kill without taking damage, the more
rupees you will have dropped for you. This is the best area in my opinion to
farm for rupees because the Tektites and Leevers are very easy to continuously
kill without taking damage. One the way back from H16, you can head north one
at H12 into G12 and kill the Moblins and Octoroks from G12 to G9 before heading
down to H9 to make it more of a loop. So: H9 to H16, H16 to H12, up to G12, G12
to G9, down to H9, and loop.

+---------------------+
|--= THE GRAVEYARD =--|
+---------------------+

In the graveyard, the Ghinis make a nice farming option. Equip your boomerang
and use it to stun the single Ghini in any screen. Then run into as many of the
tombstones as you can manage. Each one will spawn another Ghini, but they won't
take any damage. They can only be killed by defeating the original Ghini, which
you stunned with the Boomerang. Keep track of it and take it out to kill all
the Ghinis, each of which will drop something for you, usually rupees.

+----------------------------------+
|--= CHEATING THE GAMBLING GAME =--|
+----------------------------------+

This method requires using the second controller Save trick. Get bombs and save
your game. Head west one from the origin to H7. Bomb the north wall five tiles
to the left of the north path to open the cave for the Gambling game. Head in
and play the game. If you win, save the game. If you lose, you can select
"Retry" to reload your save. Do this as many times as you need, and you should
have 255 rupees shortly.

And finally, the moment you've all been waiting for: Herc's opinion. It has
been said that Herc's opinion is so devastatingly accurate at all times that
every word from his mouth ought to be considered fact. And in that regard, it's
time for me to drop some fact bombs about this game and what I think of it.

The Legend of Zelda spawned an epic, sweeping gaming franchise the likes of
which have barely been replicated by anyone else to this day. Bearing that in
mind, it's quite tough to look at this game objectively 30 years later. For the
time, it was a masterpiece of game design that pushed the boundaries of what
the current generation of consoles could do.

That being said, you certainly feel the limitations of this era's game designs
while playing through the Legend of Zelda in the modern era. The lack of
diagonal mobility and frustratingly designed enemies can make the Legend of
Zelda annoying, albeit in very brief windows. The reuse of bosses and lame
recycling of upgrade versions of items you already have (that seem to have been
downgraded specifically so the upgraded versions could exist at all) can dampen
the experience ever so slightly. But if you're someone who lets all of those
things get to you, then retro gaming just isn't for you at all.

For its time, the Legend of Zelda is a triumphant achievement. It's a joy to 
play and a challenge in the right ways (especially through the Second Quest).
Playing through it without a guide and finding your own way is not impossible
but it certainly makes the game tougher while also preserving the experience of
exploration. All in all, it's pretty much a masterpiece despite its flaws and
its highly revered by Zelda players across the world.

I give it a 9/10, it's a really fun game, slightly marred by a few questionable 
design choices, but nevertheless really enjoyable.

|--= FAQ 01 =--|
+--------------+

Q: I'm a parent and my child read your guide and it has bad words in it.
   How dare you?

A: There are several instances in this very guide where I mention that it
   will contain some content unsuitable for minors. Police what your children
   access on the internet if it's a major concern for you. It's not my job to
   control what your kids are looking at. Beyond that, I recognize this is at
   its core a game for children, so I've intentionally toned it down quite
   considerably. Besides, I read stuff like this and watched/played Rated R/M
   things when I was a kid. And I turned out alright, at least I think I did.

+--------------+
|--= FAQ 02 =--|
+--------------+

Q: The art in your guide is really cool, can I use it in mine?

A: I'd really rather you didn't. The detailed (and time-consuming) art is
   mostly what makes my guides stand out (that and my grade-A sense of humor).
   More importantly, I work hard on the ASCII art that's in my guides and it's
   not terribly difficult to learn how to do it. So, unfortunately, the answer
   to that is "no". The art is included in the copyright.

+--------------+
|--= FAQ 03 =--|
+--------------+

Q: Yo, what's up with the shape of the third Labyrinth? Are Nintendo racists?

A: No, Nintendo aren't racists. Yes, this dungeon is technically in the shape
of a swastika. No, it is NOT a swastika. It is actually a Manji. The Manji is a
character in the Buddhist philosophy/religion and represents the concept of
Dharma, universal harmony, and the balance of opposites. So, no Nintendo aren't
racists, since Buddhists are pretty much as far from racists as you can get.

Q: Okay, but they should have--

A: No, they shouldn't have. They're totally allowed to use the symbol of the 
Manji if they want. Let's also not forget that when this game first released,
Japan was in staunch denial of their participation in World War II (to this day
they still deny that the Nanking Massacre ever happened, which is shitty, I'll
grant you that), so it's not even remotely surprising that they would include
it without thinking about the association of the symbol outside of Japan.

Q: But the first dungeon is an eagle shape and that was also a Nazi symbol.

A: Why do you want Nintendo to be Nazis so damn bad? The Eagle is also an
American symbol. There's also a Tengu in Japanese mythology that looks a lot
like an eagle. Read a book and stop trying to make Nintendo look like Nazis.
Just stop it. Stop it right now.

+--------------+
|--= FAQ 04 =--|
+--------------+

Q: Why do you do so much before going to the first dungeon?

A: Why don't you? Getting all of that stuff before the first dungeon makes the
rest of the First Quest so much easier. You can seriously breeze through the
entire thing in an afternoon. You can upgrade your sword, get a better shield,
have three more hearts, and take half as much damage all before the first
dungeon. Why wouldn't you do that?

+--------------+
|--= FAQ 05 =--|
+--------------+

Q: I bought arrows, but now can't shoot any?

A: Arrows only work as long as you have rupees. Firing one arrow costs one
rupee. So as long as you have rupees, you have arrows. If you don't have any
rupees, you have no arrows. It's that simple.

+--------------+
|--= FAQ 06 =--|
+--------------+

Q: Why does my Blue Candle stop working after I shoot it?

A: Because that's it's one caveat. It only works once per screen. Nintendo
decided to limit the Blue Candle in this way so there would be a reason to want
the Red Candle that serves as a reward for completing the Demon Labyrinth.

WELCOOOOOOOOME TO THE REF-A-RENCE REF-A-ROOOOOOOOOOOO!!

That's right folks, step right up and win yourself some money. How does a free
$100 sound to you? Pretty good, don't it? Every guide put out by us that
features this section (especially if it was written by Herc) is chock full of
cheeky references to movies, tv, music, pop culture, or meme culture. Do you
have the inane and useless knowledge to catch them all? (Yes, that was one.
Consider it a freebie.)

We have a spreadsheet in our possession of every reference in this guide and
where it can be found. The first reader who can send us a near identical
spreadsheet (90% accurate) will be the proud winner of a $100 Gift Card for
their choice of gaming platform.

When someone has accurately found the references, this section will be updated
to congratulate them on their victory of wasted brain space and the list of
references will be added below. UNTIL YOU SEE THAT, the $100 Gift Card is up
for grabs. And don't kill yourself trying to find these things, they're pretty
thinly veiled, but Herc has A LOT of useless knowledge.

So, you like it. And now you want it. Well, get over it! (Joking) Should you
really, really wish to show this bad boy off, well then, I'm completely
supportive. Just make sure you meet these requirements:

                                 GIVE ME CREDIT
                                 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
For real guys... It's a lot of work.

                 I UPDATE THIS GUIDE ON THE FOLLOWING SITES ONLY

THAT'S IT! Seriously man, I have stuff to do. I love writing these, but until
it starts paying as much as my job, I can't spend all my time monitoring and
working on this. Though, I totally would if I could.

As I've said before, you don't necessarily need to ask my permission to show
off my sexiness, but don't change it in any way and make it clear that it was
not created by anyone other than me. E-mailing me to ask permission is really
not necessary. At all.

     * Do not disturb/change the guide. It exists in a delicate ecosystem
       that cannot be altered or else Ganon will resurface and destroy us all.
       So just don't.

     * Link to the Mobomu copy of this guide RATHER THAN uploading it.

     * Give me credit. Say something along the lines of:
       "This amazingly awesome dank was written by mothafuckin Hercaderk."
       Don't call me Hercaderk though. Only my friends call me that.

And there you go.
